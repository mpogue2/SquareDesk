# Introduction
SquareDesk is a super-powerful Open Source tool for for Modern Western Square 
Dance callers with MacOS computers.  It includes a music player, 
a cuesheet editor, and a powerful graphical version of the SD checker mover program.

SquareDesk itself to add cool new features or fix bugs!

# Music playback tab
The MUSIC tab is the main tab for playback of MP3 files.  Automatic
timers mean that you don't have to remember to press a Start Timer button!
Automatic section detection allows you to find the best
possible loop points, while automatic beat and measure detection 
makes it really easy to create seamless loops for patter.

SquareDesk has two primary viewing modes, DARK MODE:

# Cuesheet editor tab
A built-in cuesheet editor provides a super-simple way to edit lyrics.
Singing calls are automatically matched with cuesheets by name, so no more
"marrying" step required.  And, the cuesheets you make are self-contained, so
you can send them to your fellow callers and they'll look the same on all computers.
Cuesheets can also be automatically scrolled during singing call playback, 
to make it easy to learn or perform a song.

# SD Sequence Designer tab
You can quickly design new sequences with a built-in copy of SD, with a clean
graphical front-end, supporting automatic group/station annotation (aka "relationship
calling").
