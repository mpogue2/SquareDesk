A built-in lyrics editor provides a super-simple way to edit cuesheets.  
These cuesheets can be automatically scrolled during singing call playback, to make it easy
to learn or perform a song.

For singing calls, the transport bar clearly shows you where you are
in your opener, break, closer, and each sequence

Track how long it's been since you've played a given song for any day
of the week! Helps you rotate your music so dancers don't get sick of
it.
