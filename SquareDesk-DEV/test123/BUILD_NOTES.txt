BUILD NOTES

Mac OS X ==========================================
- OK to debug with Debug mode, but it crashes regularly in Release Mode, 
	so, we need to distribute the Debug version.
- Remember to update the version number in the mainwindow.cpp file!
- After everything works, put the file PackageIt.command into the Build
	directory (e.g. build-test123-Desktop_Qt_5_7_0_clang_64bit-Debug).
- Modify the PackageIt.command file to have the same version number.
- Then, double click on it.  This will stick the Qt libs into the .app
	file, and will create a DMG file.  Wait until the DMG window 
	disappears.  Then, test the DMG file.

- TODO: stick the docs into the DMG file in a nice way by modifying PackageIt.command.

Windows 10 ==========================================
- must compile in Release mode only (Debug will crash)
- Inno Setup to build the installer: 
	Process to be described

Linux ==========================================
- Dan!
