# Data types

`univector` class is a base of all containers in KFR.

`univector` can have both static and dynamic size and can even hold only reference to an external data (just like `array_view` or `string_view`)

`univector<float>` is derived from `std::vector<float>` and contains all its member functions and constructors.

`univector<float, 10>` is derived from `std::array<float, 10>` and contains all its member functions and constructors.

`univector<float, 0>` is only reference to data and doesnâ€™t contain any values.

Such universal template allows functions in KFR to get data in any format.

You can get subrange of an array using slice function:

```c++
univector<float, 100> v;
// ...
const float s1 = sum(v); // Sum all elements
const float s2 = sum(v.slice(2, 50)); // Sum 50 elements starting from 2
```
Result of the call to slice is always `univector<T, 0>`, a reference to external data.

The lifetime of the reference is limited to the lifetime of the original data.

!!! note
    `univector` class is also [Expression](expressions.md) and can be used whereever expression is required.

## Pass data to KFR functions

If you don't use `univector` for data representation, you can still pass the data to KFR functions and filters. 

Examples (`rms` is used as an example function that takes `univector`):

### `std::vector` or `std::array`
```c++
std::vector<float> data; // existing data, or std::array<N, float>

float val = rms(make_univector(data)); // No data copy
```

### Plain pointer
```c++
const float* data; // existing data
size_t size;       // 

float val = rms(make_univector(data, size)); // No data copy
```

### array
```c++
const float data[1024];

float val = rms(make_univector(data)); // No data copy
```
