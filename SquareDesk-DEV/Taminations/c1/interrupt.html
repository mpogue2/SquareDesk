<h2>Interrupt</h2>

<p>The dance action of the call will temporarily be suspended at one or
    more places, at which point the specified action will be performed.
    The place can be described by its part (e.g., &quot;after the third part&quot;)
    or by its definition (e.g., &quot;before turning the stars&quot;). Example:
    &quot;Square Chain Thru, Interrupt before the last part with a Spin the
    Top&quot;.</p>

<p>
  Special note for Replace, Interrupt, But, Skip, and Delete: All of
  these modifiers may change each dancer's position in the formation or
  even change the formation itself. When the dancers resume their
  execution of the call, they must reevaluate their position in the
  formation and their new part in the definition. Examples: &quot;Square Chain
  Thru, Interrupt before the last part with a Spin the Top&quot; and &quot;Swing
  the Fractions, Interrupt after each part with a Circulate&quot;.
