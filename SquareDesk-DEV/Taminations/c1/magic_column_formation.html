<title>Magic Column Formation/Concept</title>
</head>
<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Magic Column Formation/Concept</h2>
<p>A Magic Column consists of the ends of one column and the
centers of the other column. The dancers act as though
they were in a column together, beginning and ending on
those four spots.</p>
<p>Do the call as usual, but if you move from end to center or
center to end, follow the Magic Column Circulate path.
Note that a single magic column is neither right- nor
left-handed. You must follow the Magic traffic pattern, and
perform any action using the hand appropriate to your
position at that point in the call.
</p>

<h2>Magic Column Circulate</h2>
<p>From magic columns: Each dancer moves forward along
one of the two circulate paths shown below:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<p>
If an end and a center are facing each other, they pass
using the end's inside shoulder (the center dancer moves
first). This takes the place of the right-shoulder rule. So
Magic Column Circulate 1&frac12; would end like so:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="magic_column_circulate_2.png" />
</p>
<p>
Teaching Hint: You can point out that the ends are
holding opposite hands from the centers--e.g., the ends
have right hands joined, and the centers have left hands
joined.
</p>
<p>If you leave the circulate path (e.g., in Magic Column
Transfer, shown below), just finish the call as usual. In
this example, the ending wave is left-handed because the
centers have lefts before the final Extend:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

<p>
In the case of Magic Column <a href="../ms/walk_and_dodge.html"> Walk and Dodge</a>, the rules
are the same: Those who are doing the Walk follow the
circulate path, and those doing the Dodge (and thus
leaving the circulate path) just slide sideways as usual:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="magic_column_circulate_4.png" />
</p>
<p>
Note:
Magic column calls are only permitted where complete
magic columns exist. It would be improper, for example, to
call "Magic Walk and Dodge" from an inverted box in
isolation.
</p>
<p>Note: At C-1 this concept is restricted to right or left-hand Magic Columns only.</p>
