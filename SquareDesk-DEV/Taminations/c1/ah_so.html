<h2>Ah So</h2>
<p>From a wave or line: With each half of the wave/line working as a unit, the ends
<a href="../ms/fold.html"> Cross Fold</a> and the centers
follow along so as to keep each mini-wave or couple intact. If the ends start out facing the same way, they pass right
shoulders as they go.<br /></p>
