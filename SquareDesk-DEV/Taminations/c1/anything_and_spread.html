<p>In addition to the three ways Spread is used at
Plus, there is a fourth way:</p>
<p>If specific dancers are directed to Spread (e.g., Everyone Trade, Boys
Spread), they slide away from the adjacent dancer one position. The
inactive dancers do not move. This can be used to create an Hourglass
