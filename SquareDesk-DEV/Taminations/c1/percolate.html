<h2>Percolate</h2>
<p>From appropriate parallel waves or lines, or eight chain
thru: <span class="Part1"><a href="../b1/circulate.html"> Circulate</a></span>,
<span class="Part2">&frac12; (Half) Circulate</span>.
<span class="Part3">The center 4 (those in the wave)
<a href="../ms/hinge.html">Hinge</a></span>
and <span class="Part4">those centers facing in
<a href="../a1/anything_and_cross.html">Cross</a></span>.
Meanwhile, <span class="Part3"><span class="Part4">the ends <a href="../ms/turn_thru.html">
Turn Thru</a> or Left Turn Thru</span></span> as appropriate. From
most places (e.g., waves) this ends in lines back to back.
It can be done from anywhere the Circulate, &frac12; (Half) Circulate gives
a definite center wave.
</p>
<p>"Percolate But" means the Hinge and Cross is replaced by the &ldquo;But&rdquo; call.
The ends complete the call as usual.</p>
