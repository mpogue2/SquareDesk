<h2>Phantom Formation</h2>
<p>A Phantom is a non-existent dancer with whom you may
be asked to work. A Phantom formation (e.g., after
Heads <a href="../a1/wheel_thru.html"> Wheel Thru</a>, <a href="../b2/swing_thru.html"> Swing
Thru</a>, Heads <a href="../ms/hinge.html">Hinge</a>) has the
dancers arranged as shown below. Some of the dancers
are in lines at the head, and some are in lines at the
side. Each dancer acts as though he or she were in
parallel waves or lines with all the Phantom positions
occupied by real dancers.

</p>
<p>
It is also possible to have a phantom formation where some
of the dancers feel like they're in columns (as below).
However, this variation is not appropriate for use at C-1.
