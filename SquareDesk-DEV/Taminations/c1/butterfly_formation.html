<h2>Butterfly Formation / Concept</h2>
<p>A butterfly is a column formation with the ends of the column separated by 2 positions.</p>

<p><b>Butterfly Circulate</b><br/>
From a butterfly: All dancers move
forward one position along the path below:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<p>

<b>Other Butterfly calls, such as Split Circulate, Walk and Dodge</b><br/>
 Any call which can be done from parallel general
columns (columns, double pass thru, etc.), and which ends
in general lines or columns, can be done from a butterfly.
The dancers act as though the ends were close together;
however, they end on the original 8 spots on the floor. For
example, "Butterfly <a href="../b2/double_pass_thru.html"> Double Pass Thru</a>":
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="butterfly_formation_2.png" />
</p>
<p>
The ending formation is always the same as though the
ends stepped together, everyone did the call, and the ends
slid apart again--the same eight spots on the floor are
occupied at the end of the call as when it began.
