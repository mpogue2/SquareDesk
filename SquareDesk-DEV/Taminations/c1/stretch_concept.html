<h2>Stretch Concept</h2>
<p>
From all appropriate formations: The modifier "Stretch" is
used as a prefix, applied to two- or four-person calls only.
Do the 2- or 4-person call as usual, but the people who end
in the center move to the center spots farthest from the
dancers they had been working with (by moving along the
long axis of the formation). For example, Stretch <a href="../ms/recycle.html">Recycle</a>:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

<img alt="" src="stretch_concept_1.png" />
</p>
<p>
or Stretch <a href="shakedown.html"> Shake Down</a>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

<img alt="" src="stretch_concept_2.png" /></p>
<p>
or Stretch <a href="../a1/turn_and_deal.html"> Turn and Deal</a>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

<img alt="" src="stretch_concept_3.png" /></p>
<p>
or Stretch <a href="../b2/touch_a_quarter.html"> Touch 1/4</a>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

<img alt="" src="stretch_concept_4.png" /></p>
<p>
or Stretch Touch:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

<img alt="" src="stretch_concept_5.png" />
</p>
<p>
If the centers cannot move along the long axis of the
formation to get away from the ends they'd been working
with, then the call is improper. For example, Stretch
Swing Thru is not proper from here:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

<img alt="" src="stretch_concept_6.png" />
</p>
<p>
because after the Swing Thru, the centers would have to
move along the short axis of the formation to get away
from the ends.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, one may not call Centers Stretch Touch 1/4
from here
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

<img alt="" src="stretch_concept_7.png" />
</p>
<p>
because the centers weren't working with the ends on
the Touch 1/4.
</p>
<p>
Note: The examples above are here only to clarify the
definition. They don't necessarily represent good usage--
particularly Stretch Turn and Deal from left-hand
two-faced lines. Common applications include
Recycle, Ah So, and Turn and Deal (from right-hand two-faced lines).
</p>
<p>
Teaching Hint: This call is usually danced with those
coming to the center actually going to the far center spots,
rather than first completing the move on their own side.
