<h2>Left</h2>

<p>Do the call interchanging right with left, clockwise with
    counter-clockwise, and promenade with reverse promenade. This modifier
    is usually used with calls which start with a Pull By or Pass Thru
    (i.e., &quot;Left Pass And Roll&quot; and &quot;Left Square Chain Thru&quot;, but not
    &quot;Left Swap Around&quot;). In Challenge dancing, the left versions of the
    calls are part of the program even though they are not explicitly
    listed.</p>
