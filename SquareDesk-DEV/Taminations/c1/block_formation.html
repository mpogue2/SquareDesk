<title>Block Formation</title>

<h2>Block Formation</h2>
<p>
A block is a 4x4 matrix in which no 2 real bodies have a
real body between them. There is 1 space between all
bodies in a block: in front, in back, left and right.
</p>
<p>
In blocks you can do only 4-person calls (or sequences of
calls) that start and end in a 2x2 formation. e.g. <a href="../b2/trade.html"> Partner
Trade</a>, <a href="../adv/partner_tag.html"> Partner Tag</a>, <a href="../b1/pass_thru.html"> Pass
Thru</a>, <a href="../b2/touch_a_quarter.html"> Touch 1/4</a>, <a href="../b1/star_thru.html"> Star
Thru</a>, <a href="../b1/square_thru.html">
Square Thru</a>, <a href="../a1/wheel_thru.html"> Wheel Thru</a>, etc. When doing a call in a
block, each dancer works only with the dancers in his
block; all block calls start and end on the same 4 spots on
the floor.
e.g., In Your Block, <a href="../ms/walk_and_dodge.html"> Walk and Dodge</a>:

</p>
<p>
For some calls, e.g., In Your Block, <a href="../a1/square_chain_thru.html"> Square Chain
Thru</a>,
the dancers are working in a wave during the call's action.
In that case, the waves are slightly offset from each other,
just as the blocks are slightly offset.
e.g., In Your Block, <a href="../a1/square_chain_thru.html"> Square Chain Thru</a>:
