<h2>Replace / But / Skip / Delete</h2>

<h3>Replace</h3>
  <ul><li>Dancers can be asked to replace (i.e., substitute) one or more
    parts of the call (including the remainder of the call) with a
    different dance action. The part to be replaced can be described by
    its part number (e.g., &quot;the third part&quot;) or by its dance action (e.g.,
    &quot;the stars&quot;, &quot;the centers trade&quot;). See also,
    But. Examples: &quot;Scoot and
    Plenty, Replace the Box Circulates with a Motivate&quot;, &quot;Swing the
    Fractions, Replace the third part with a Split Circulate&quot;, &quot;Scoot and
    Plenty, Replace the Box Circulates with an Explode the Wave and do not
    finish the Plenty&quot;.</li></ul>

<h3>But</h3>
<ol>
    <li>For some calls, the definition specifies a stopping point for
      some (or all) dancers when &quot;But&quot; is used. In this case those dancers
      replace the rest of their part of the call with the designated
      action. Calls which end with the centers casting off 3/4, while the
      ends do something else traditionally have the &quot;But&quot; mean for the
      centers to replace the final Cast Off 3/4 with the indicated call.
      Examples: &quot;Tally Ho, But Explode the Wave&quot;, &quot;Chain Reaction, But 2/3
      Recycle&quot;.</li>
    <li>Used to obtain the dancers' attention. In this case it is
      followed by one of the other modifying terms. Example: &quot;Pass the
      Axle, But skip the third part&quot;, &quot;Motivate, But, Replace the star with
      a U-Turn Back&quot;.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Skip</h3>
<ul><li>A shorthand for &quot;Replace With Nothing&quot;. Example: &quot;Pass the Axle, Skip the third part&quot;.
</li></ul>


<h3>Delete</h3>
<ul><li>Another shorthand for &quot;Replace With Nothing&quot;. Example: &quot;Delete all arm turn 1/2's and Spin Chain the Gears&quot;.
</li></ul>

<p>
  Special note for Replace, Interrupt, But, Skip, and Delete: All of
  these modifiers may change each dancer's position in the formation or
  even change the formation itself. When the dancers resume their
  execution of the call, they must reevaluate their position in the
  formation and their new part in the definition. Examples: &quot;Square Chain
  Thru, Interrupt before the last part with a Spin the Top&quot; and &quot;Swing
  the Fractions, Interrupt after each part with a Circulate&quot;.
