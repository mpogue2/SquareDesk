<title>O Formation / Concept</title>

<h2>O Formation / Concept</h2>
<p>An &quot;O&quot; is a column formation with the centers spread
apart (2 spaces between them). Any call that can be done
from General Columns (Columns, Double Pass Thru,
etc.), and which ends in General Lines or General Columns,
can be done from &quot;O&quot; Formation.
</p>

<p><b>O Circulate</b><br/>
From an O: Each dancer moves forward one spot along the circulate path shown below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="o_formation_1.png" /></p>

<p><b>Other O Calls</b><br/>
Any call which can be done from
General Columns (Columns, Double Pass Thru, etc.), and which ends in
General Lines or General Columns, can be
done from an O. The dancers act as though the centers
were close together; however, they end on the same 8 spots
on the floor. For example, "O <a href="../b2/double_pass_thru.html"> Double Pass
Thru</a>":
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="o_formation_2.png" />
</p>
<p>O <a href="../ms/walk_and_dodge.html"> Walk and Dodge</a>:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="o_formation_3.png" /></p>
<p>O <a href="../b2/swing_thru.html"> Swing Thru</a>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="o_formation_4.png" /></p>
<p>
But can't O Swing Thru from here:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

<img alt="" src="o_formation_5.png" />
</p>
<p>
That last one is an O Magic Column. There is no such
thing as an "O Wave".
In order for O Swing Thru to
work the General Column must be an Eight Chain Thru formation.
</p>
<p>The effect of an O call is exactly the same as having the
centers slide together, doing the call, and having the new
centers slide apart so that the original 8 spots on the
floor are again occupied.
</p>
<p>Common applications include Circulate, Split Circulate, and Walk and Dodge.</p>
