<h2>Box/Split Recycle</h2>
<p>From box circulate formation:
Without letting go hands with the leads, the trailers <a href="../plus/extend.html">
Extend</a> and <a href="../b1/turn_back.html"> U-Turn Back</a>, to end with their original
outside hands joined. The leads follow along, becoming
the ends of the resulting wave.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<p>
From 2x2 formations where half the box is a couple and
the other is a right-hand mini-wave: Those in the couple
do a <a href="../a2/recycle.html"> facing-couples Recycle</a>, and those in the mini-wave
do a Split Recycle. This ends in a right-hand wave.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="box_split_recycle_2.png" />
</p>
<p>
This can't be done when the mini-wave is left-handed:

</p>
<p>
Where not otherwise ambiguous, it is permissible to call
simply, "Recycle" when you mean "Split Recycle". For
example, from columns, you could call "Outsides <a href="../adv/partner_tag.html"> Partner
Tag</a> while the centers Recycle" and the meaning is clear.
From parallel waves, though, "Recycle" and "Split Recycle"
are different, and one must not be called when the other is
meant.
