  <h2>Little</h2>

    From one-quarter tag or three-quarter tag: Outsides Quarter Right, or
    as directed, and then <a href="counter_rotate.html"> Counter
      Rotate &frac14;</a>. Centers <a href="step_and_fold.html"> Step and
      Fold</a>. Ends in parallel waves or lines. The quartering direction for
    the outsides may be specified, as in "Left Little" or "Right Little"
    [outsides go left or right, respectively.]

  <p>From Diamonds, there are many ways to direct the points to
    Counter Rotate without turning first, including: &quot;Little, points go as
    you are&quot;, &quot;Little, Points go forward&quot;, and &quot;Centers Start, Little&quot;.
    (See Glossary of Modifying Terms: Start.) The command &quot;Little&quot; (with
    no direction given) requires the points to 1/4 Right before they
    Counter Rotate. See the historical note below.</p>

  <p>Consider the following two cases:</p>
  <p style="text-align: center">
    <img alt="" src="little_2a.png" />
    <img alt="" src="little_2b.png" />
    <img alt="" src="little_2c.png" />
  </p>


  <p>Historical note: In a previous definition Diamonds were a
    special exception because, without any words by the caller, the points
    would automatically go forward. Today the caller must direct the
    points to go &quot;as you are&quot;.</p>
