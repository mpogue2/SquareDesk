<h2>(Anything) and Weave</h2>
<p>From box circulate: The leads do &frac12; a <a href="../b1/circulate.html"> Box Circulate</a> while
the trailers walk forward on a slight diagonal to meet each other with their original
outside hands (thought of by some as Cross Extend) and Hinge. From
single eight chain thru: All Pass Thru, and the ends Quarter Right while
the centers Left Touch 1/4 (this is like Touch and Weave).
