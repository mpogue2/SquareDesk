<h2>Cross Over Circulate</h2>

<p>At C-1, Crossover Circulate uses the following definition, 
which allows additional starting formations.</p>

<p>In one motion, Circulate and Half Sashay (do your part).
  During the call, if two dancers would occupy the same space and 
  they are facing the same direction, the belle goes in front of the beau;
   if they are facing each other, they pass right shoulders.
</p>

<p> From Facing Couples (e.g., Facing Lines or an Eight Chain Thru),
 Crossover Circulate is danced as a Cross Trail Thru and cannot be fractionalized.
