<body><div class="definition">
<h2>(Anything) to a Wave</h2>
<p>From wherever is appropriate for the "Anything" call:
The "Anything" call must have as its final action
a Step Thru or Extend.
Do all of the "Anything" call, except for the final Step Thru or Extend. For
example, in <a href="../a1/square_chain_thru.html"> Square Chain Thru to a Wave</a>, the dancers
would do all of the call except for stepping forward on the
final Turn Thru:

<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="anything_to_a_wave_2.png" /></p>
<p>Additional applications include Scoot Chain Thru To A Wave, Load the
Boat Centers to a Wave, Percolate Outsides to a Wave, Flip Back to a
Wave, or Tag Back to a Wave to a Wave.</p>
<p>When used with Tagging Calls Back to a Wave, some callers prefer to
say "Centers to a Wave". For example: Flip Back Centers to a Wave, or
Tag Back to a Wave Centers to a Wave.</p>
<p>Do not be confused by calls which contain "to a Wave" as part of their
name (e.g. Dosado to a Wave, Single Circle to a Wave, Tag Back to a
Wave, Cross Roll to a Wave).</p>
