<title>Circle By (m and n)</title>

<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Circle By (m and n)</h2>
<p>
From facing couples: This call requires that two
fractions, m and n, be called as part of its name, e.g.,
"Circle By 1/4 and 1/2". All join hands and <a href="../b1/circle.html"> Circle Left</a>
m. Then Touch and Cast Off n. If n is "Nothing", you
just step to the wave. The second fraction (n), may be
replaced by another call, as in "Circle By 1/2 and <a href="../ms/recycle.html">Recycle</a>". In that case, the Cast Off is replaced by the call
specified. In this example, the dancers would <a href="../b1/circle.html"> Circle Left</a>
1/2, Touch, then <a href="../ms/recycle.html">Recycle</a>, ending in facing couples.
