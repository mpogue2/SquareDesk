<h2>Single Wheel</h2>
<p>From a couple or mini-wave only: With each dancer taking the part of an entire couple,
do a <a href="../b2/wheel_and_deal.html"> Wheel and Deal</a>. This call cannot be fractionalized.</p>
<p>For teaching: You can think of this as a <a href="../ms/hinge.html"> Hinge</a> and
<a href="../plus/anything_and_roll.htmL">Roll</a>. However, this call has only
one part&mdash;it cannot be fractionalized.</p>
