<h2>Box Counter Rotate</h2>
<p>From any 4-dancer formation with no dancers facing the flagpole center [<em>At
Advanced, this call is used only from a 2X2 formation, e.g. Box Circulate</em>]:
This call may have a fraction after it, such as Box Counter Rotate 3/4. If no fraction is
given, it means Box Counter Rotate 1/4.</p>
<p>For each 1/4 in the fraction: Each dancer moves his position in the formation forward
around the center of the formation 90&deg;, by walking forward in a smooth arc to reach that
spot. Each dancer works independently of the other 3 dancers in his formation.</p>
<p>Every dancer can <a href="../plus/anything_and_roll.htmL"> Roll</a> at the end of this call.</p>
<p>The diagrams below show the beginning and ending positions for a single dancer, for
every spot in a box circulate formation.</p>
<p>Example -- Box Counter Rotate 1/4:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="box_counter_rotate_1a.png"/><img alt="" src="box_counter_rotate_1b.png"/><img alt="" src="box_counter_rotate_1c.png"/><img alt="" src="box_counter_rotate_1d.png"/>
</p>
<p>Example&mdash;Box Counter Rotate 3/4:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="box_counter_rotate_2a.png"/><img alt="" src="box_counter_rotate_2b.png"/><img alt="" src="box_counter_rotate_2c.png"/><img alt="" src="box_counter_rotate_2d.png"/>
</p>
<p>For Teaching: Think of this as Promenading 1/4 in the formation; that captures the
smoothness of the call. You can also have the leads <a href="../a1/quarter_in.html"> Quarter In</a> and
<a href="../b1/circulate.html"> Box Circulate</a>, while
the trailers <a href="../b1/circulate.html"> Box Circulate</a> and <a href="../a1/quarter_in.html"> Quarter
In</a>. That gets the dancers to the right place.</p>
