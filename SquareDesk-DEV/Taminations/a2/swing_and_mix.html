<h2>Swing and Mix</h2>

  <p>From an ocean wave or inverted line: ends and adjacent centers Turn
  1/2; Centers <a href="../b2/run.html">Cross Run</a>; resulting Centers
  <a href="../b2.trade.html">Trade</a>. The
  <a href="../b2/facing_couples_rule.html">Facing Couples Rule</a> applies to this call.</p>


  <p>Note: There are two ways in which Swing and
  Mix is not simply the call
  <a href="swing.html">Swing</a> followed by the call
  <a href="../a1/mix.html">Mix</a>. First,
  reflecting historical usage, Swing and Mix is a single call with three
  parts while (Any Call) and Mix are two separate calls. Second, from
  facing couples, Swing and Mix is proper even though Swing is improper.
