<h2>Spin the Windmill</h2>
<p>
      From anywhere with a center wave or center facing couples (e.g.,
      3/4 Tag, Trade By): Centers <a href="swing.html">Swing</a>,
      <a href="slip.html">Slip</a>, and
      <a href="../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.html">Cast Off &frac34;</a>,
      while the outsides face as directed and
      <a href="../b1/circulate.html">Circulate</a>
      two positions. If the centers start in facing couples, they first
      Touch, then finish the call.
    </p>
<p>Left Spin the Windmill is the same, except that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
      It may only be used with the centers in facing couples or a
      left-hand wave.</li>

<li>
      If the centers are in facing couples, they Left Touch before doing
      the Swing, Slip, and Cast Off &frac34;.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
      For teaching: You can describe the centers' part as
      <a href="../b2/swing_thru.html">Swing Thru</a> and
      <a href="../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.html">Cast Off &frac34;</a>
      , or as Left Swing Thru and Cast Off &frac34;, depending on the
      handedness of the wave.
