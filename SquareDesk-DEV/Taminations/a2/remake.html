<h2>Remake</h2>
<p>From a right hand mini-wave box,
or a left-hand facing diamond:
<span id="Part1">Those who can
 Turn &frac14; by the Right,</span>
<span id="Part2">those who can Turn &frac12; by the Left,</span>
<span id="Part3">and those who can Turn &frac34; by the Right.</span>
</p>
<p>For each part of the call, there must be a dancer performing this part and the immediately preceding
or following one. For example, the call is not proper from an Inverted Box.</p>
<p>The left-hand version of Remake is called "Left Remake".</p>
<p>The name of the formation may be added at the end of the call (e.g., Remake The Wave)
as a help to the dancers but doing so is optional.</p>
<p>If there are two side-by-side formations, each of which can do the call, dancers don't
move from one to the other. From right-hand columns, for example, each of the two box
circulate formations does the call independently.</p>
<p>The exception to the remake rules is "<a href="remake_the_thar.html">Remake The Thar</a>".</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: Alamo 12, others 10</p>
