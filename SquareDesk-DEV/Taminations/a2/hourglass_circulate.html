<h2>Hourglass Circulate</h2>
<p>From an hourglass: Each dancer does a <a href="../b1/circulate.html"> Circulate</a> by moving forward one position in the
hourglass, to take that dancer's place. Dancers move along the path shown:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="hourglass_circulate.png"/></p>
<p>Points become centers, and centers become points. Also, the diamond dancers move to the
box, and the box dancers move to the diamond.</p>
<p>For Teaching: Tell each dancer to move up to the next person's spot in the hourglass,
taking his footsteps. During this call, everyone keeps the same shoulder toward the center
of the set. This is a good call for using a demonstration square.</p>
