<h2>Cloverleaf</h2>

<p class="full">The general action of a Cloverleaf has the active dancers walking in a 3/4 circle, staying in their own
quadrant of the set. A cloverleaf ramp at a highway intersection or the edge of one leaf of a four-leaf clover
gives a good visual picture of the dance path.</p>

The lead dancers in each tandem separate and move away from each other in a
three quarter (270 degrees) circle. When each lead dancer approaches another
lead dancer from the other side of the square, they both reach with outside
hands, blending into a couple handhold as they continue into the center of
the square. Each trailing dancer follows the lead dancer in front and ends
directly behind that same dancer, taking the hand of the trailing dancer
from the other side of the square.

As dancers meet each other, they use couples handholds.</p>

<p class="full">As a pleasing variation, some dancers use a sweeping gesture during the call,
letting go of the starting handhold and offering the same hand for the final handhold,
without dropping the arm in between.</p>

A &quot;Cloverleaf&quot; ramp at a highway intersection, or one leaf of a
&quot;four-leaf clover&quot; paints a very good picture of the dance path to be followed.
