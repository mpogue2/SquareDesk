<h2>Dixie Style to an Ocean Wave</h2>

<div class="full">
<p>Starting formation - facing couples or facing
tandems. From facing couples, the right hand dancer steps forward and to the left to
become the lead dancer in a tandem. Lead dancers join right hands and pull by. Moving to
the other trailing dancer, each extends a left hand and touches to a left hand mini wave
and turns one quarter (90&deg;). New center dancers join right hands and form a left hand ocean
wave. </p>

<p class="styling">STYLING: Lead dancers initially pulling by in the center should use handshake hold as in  right and left grand. When forming mini waves with trailing dancers, dancers must adjust to the right, using hands-up position and same styling as in  swing thru.</p>

<p class="timing">Timing: SS, heads or sides to the wave, 6; all 4 couples to the wave, 8.</p>
