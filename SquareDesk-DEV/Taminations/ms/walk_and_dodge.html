<p>Starting formation - box circulate or facing couples. From
box circulate formation, each dancer facing into the box walks forward to take the place

box steps sideways (dodges) into the position vacated by the "walker" who was
formerly beside him. Dancers end side by side, both facing out. If walk and dodge is
called from facing couples, the caller must designate who is to walk and who is to dodge
(e.g., "men walk, ladies dodge"). Ending is a box circulate formation. </p>

facing couples, the caller must designate who is to walk and who is to dodge

<div class="teaching-tip"><b>Calling Tip</b>
Be careful when using this call as some calls don't flow well or feel good
after a Walk and Dodge (e.g., &quot;Walk and Dodge, Bend the Line&quot; or
&quot;Walk and Dodge, Wheel and Deal&quot; are not good body flow for half of the dancers).
