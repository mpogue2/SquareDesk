While executing the call and at the completion of the call use Ocean Wave hand
holds with elbows kept in close. By applying ever so slight pressure to assist
the opposite dancer these arm turns should be smooth and effortless as in a
weaving motion along the line.

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>The Facing Couples Rule applies to this call.</p>
<p>The combination &quot;Spin The Top, Right and Left Thru&quot;
must be delivered so that dancers adjust their
hands as necessary for the Right and Left Thru instead of first finishing the Spin The Top in a
hands-up Ocean Wave.</p>
<p>When Spin The Top is used from an Ocean Wave of 3 dancers, the caller must specify who starts (e.g.,
Right Spin The Top, Starting With The Right Spin The Top, Boys Start Spin The Top). The designated
dancers Turn 1/2. The non-designated dancer and the new center dancer Turn 3/4 while the other
dancer moves up around the outside of the formation to end in a new Ocean Wave of 3 dancers. This
usage is uncommon.</p>
<p>From a Left-Hand Ocean Wave, the phrase &quot;Left Spin The Top&quot; is acceptable.
&quot;Left&quot; is a helping word
(see &quot;Part 4: Additional Detail: Commands: Extra words&quot;).</p>
<p>From a Right-Hand Ocean Wave, the phrases &quot;Left Spin The Top&quot; and
&quot;Centers Start, Spin The Top&quot; are improper.</p>
</div>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Teaching Tip</b>
As in Cast Off 3/4, have the centers, who are doing the Cast, keep their
inactive hand down until the completion of the call. If their inactive hand
comes up prematurely, it could cause a tendency to stop too soon instead of
finishing their 3/4 turn. Remind dancers that they will end up with the same
dancer they started with and with the same hand touching.
