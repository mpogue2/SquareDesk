<h2>Fold Family</h2>
<p>Starting formation - any two dancer formation in which the
directed dancer has a shoulder directly adjacent to the other dancer. <b> GENERAL
RULE</b>:
Directed dancers step forward and move in a small semi-circle to end facing toward an
adjacent dancer or position. The adjacent inactive dancer may be facing in any direction
and does not move. If not specified, centers fold toward ends and vice versa. </p>
<ul>

<li>
<b>BOYS FOLD, GIRLS FOLD, ENDS FOLD, CENTERS FOLD</b>: Directed active dancers fold toward
the inactive dancers using the general rule.</li>

<li>
<b>CROSS FOLD</b>: Starting formation - line,
two-faced line, or wave. The directed (active) dancers who must either both be centers or
both be ends, fold toward the farthest inactive dancer by walking in a semi-circle to end
facing toward that same dancer. When the active dancers are both facing the same
direction, they move forward in a semi-circle, pass each other and fold toward the
inactive dancer.</li>

</ul>
<p class="styling">STYLING: Hand position depends on starting formation, i.e, hands up from a wave, couple handhold from a line or circulate. Using appropriate hand position, the inactive dancer should exert slight pressure to adjacent dancer and assist in initiating folding action.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: Fold, 2 steps; cross fold, 4 steps.</p>
