  <div class="parts"><b>CONCEPT</b></div>
  
  <p>Triple Diamonds consist of three adjacent Diamond formations
    some of which have positions occupied by phantoms.</p>

  <p>The two most common types of Triple Diamonds are illustrated
    below.</p>

</p>
  <p>Triple Diamonds are analogous to Triple Boxes/Columns/Lines/Waves [C-1].
   The named call is executed within each group of four.</p>

</p>

  <p>Note: Triple Diamond calls are (4 or less)-dancer calls, requiring
    you to work only with the dancers in your Diamond. The historical
    application of 8-dancer calls such as Diamond Chain Thru is
    considered improper at C3A.</p>
