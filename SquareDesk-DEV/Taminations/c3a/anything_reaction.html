<h2>&lt;anything&gt; (Cross) Reaction</h2>

<p>
	The
	&lt;anything&gt; call is one where the modifier &quot;(Centers) to a
	Wave&quot; would result in a 1/4 Tag. The dancers do the &lt;anything&gt;
	call to that point, and then do a full Chain Reaction (or Cross Chain
	Reaction). Conventions for how the &lt;anything&gt; call is
	named in this context are explained in the subsections below. 
</p>

<h3>Scoot (Chain Thru) (Cross) Reaction</h3>
<p>From Parallel Ocean Waves: Scoot Back (or Scoot Chain Thru),
	Centers to a Wave (i.e., leaving off the final Extend); then do a
	full Chain Reaction (or Cross Chain Reaction). Note that for a Scoot
	Back, the word &quot;Back&quot; is not spoken.</p>

</p>

<h3>&lt;tag&gt; (Cross) Reaction</h3>
<p>
	The starting formation depends on the
	&lt;tag&gt; action. Do the Scoot Back variation of that tagging
	action (i.e. get to the 1/2 Tag position and then Scoot Back) leaving
	off the final Extend, then do a full Chain Reaction (or Cross Chain
	Reaction).

</p>

<p>Note that there is an unspoken &quot;Back&quot; (Scoot Back) in this
case, e.g., Tag Reaction means Tag Back Reaction. The center wave
always does the trading action of the Scoot Back before starting the
Chain Reaction.</p>

<h3>&lt;anything&gt; (Cross) Reaction</h3>
<p>For any other applicable call, do that call (Centers) to a
	Wave, then do a full Chain Reaction (or Cross Chain Reaction). This
	is most commonly used at C-3A with calls in the Transfer the Column
	family, e.g., Triple Play Cross Reaction. (Note: The specific case of
	Open Up the Column Reaction is typically abbreviated as &quot;Open Up
	Reaction&quot;.)</p>
