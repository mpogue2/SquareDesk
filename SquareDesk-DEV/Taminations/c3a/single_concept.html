<title>Single Calls</title>

<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Single Calls</h2>

<p>The calls in this section are all variations on other calls
	with similar names. In these calls, each dancer performs an action
	similar to what two dancers would be doing in the original call. They
	are &quot;half size&quot; versions of the original calls, involving half as
	many dancers (4 instead of 8, or 2 instead of 4).</p>
<p>Note that there are other calls that have a similar
	relationship (e.g., &quot;Single Wheel&quot; is the 2-dancer version of Wheel
	and Deal), but there are also calls with names beginning with the
	word &quot;Single&quot; that do not relate to another call in the same way
	(e.g., &quot;Single Circle to a Wave&quot;). Refer to the definition of each
	individual call to find out its meaning. Also note that the two-word
	combination &quot;Single File&quot; has a different meaning.</p>
