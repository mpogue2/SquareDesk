<h2>&lt;anything&gt; Choice</h2>
<div class="parts"><b>Parts: </b>2</div>

From any applicable formation: Do the &lt;anything&gt; call 
followed by the two parts of Choice (Center Line Lockit as Others Trade; 
Center Line Hinge as Others Step and Fold). 
Usually, to make clear that the &lt;anything&gt; call 
is to be treated as part of the larger call, 
it will be spoken with the suffix &quot;er’s&quot;, e.g., &quot;Spin the Topper’s Choice&quot;.
