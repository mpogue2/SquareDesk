<title>Exchange the Boxes / Triangles</title>
</head>
<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Exchange the Boxes / Triangles</h2>

<p>To perform an &quot;Exchange&quot;, dancers in two adjacent similar
  formations circulate, first in their own formation, and then in the
  adjacent formation. The total number of circulates for a full
  Exchange is equal to the number of positions in a single formation of
  that type. Dancers circulate in their own formation until they reach
  their &quot;exchange point&quot;, which is the point in their normal circulate
  path when they are closest to, but not facing away from, the center
  of the overall formation. Their next circulate is into the other
  formation, crossing over to the spot in that formation which
  corresponds to the one where they would have gone for a normal
  circulate. Once they have crossed over into the other formation, they
  stay to the outside of any dancers who are still circulating in their
  original formation, but finish at the end of the call on the
  footprints of the original formation when possible.</p>

<h3>Exchange the Boxes</h3>
<div class="parts"><b>Parts: </b>4</div>

<p>From a 2x4 formation: Do a total of four Split Circulates
	except that when you reach your exchange point (when you are an
	in-facing Center) do your next Circulate to the diagonal opposite
	position (crossing over into the other Box). In most cases there will
	be one Center from each Box who will lead the Exchange and everyone
	else in their Box can follow them. A full exchange ends in a 2x4
	formation; Mini-Wave Boxes end in opposite-handed Mini-Wave Boxes.</p>

<h3>Exchange the Triangles</h3>
<div class="parts"><b>Parts: </b>3</div>

<p>From Twin Triangles: Do a total of three Triangle Circulates
	except that when you reach your exchange point do your next Circulate
	to the other Triangle. From Apex-to-Apex Triangles, the exchange
	point is the apex and this Circulate is an Interlocked Triangle
	Circulate; from Base-to-Base Triangles, the exchange point is when
	you are a base facing into the center of the set and this Circulate
	is to the diagonal opposite position. RH or LH Triangles end in
	opposite-handed Triangles.</p>
