	re-evaluate the setup as the call progresses.</p>

<b>Teaching Notes</b>
For dancers in general lines, this can also be thought of as 
Ends Split Circulate twice as Centers Once-Removed Circulate twice. 
For dancers in generalized columns, this can be thought of as 
Ends Split Circulate twice as Centers Magic Circulate twice. 
An even simpler formulation from lines, though it is not faithful to the Roll behavior, 
is all (do your part of) Tandem Cross Roll to a Wave/Line.
