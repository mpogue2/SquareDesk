<p>Note: Determine who are the designated dancers before doing the
	Hinge, not after. For example, from a Couple: Patch the Beaus is a
	Partner Hinge (now both dancers are Beaus) followed by original Beau
	U-Turn Back. Similarly, from Parallel Lines: Patch the Ends refers to
	the original Ends, not those who become Ends after the Hinge.</p>
