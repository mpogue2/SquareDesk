<div class="parts"><b>CONCEPT</b></div>

<p>From a Generalized 1/4 Tag or other applicable formations: Jay
	identifies distorted boxes, each consisting of two dancers from a
	center 1x4 (e.g., line or column) and two outside dancers. The
	outsides with whom each center dancer should work is most commonly
	determined by the facing direction of the center dancers; the facing
	direction of the outside dancers does not matter.</p>
<p>Front Jay means that the centers work in a box with the
	outsides toward whom they are facing, Back Jay means that they work
	with the outsides who are behind them, Left Jay means that they work
	with the outsides who are to their left; similarly for Right Jay. If
	no direction is specified, the default is Front.</p>

</p>

<p>Same Jay means to do the call in the same distorted box as for
	the previous call, regardless of the current facing direction of the
	centers. Change Jays means that the centers work with the outsides
	with whom they were not working for the previous call.</p>
<p>The resulting formation for each box must be either a box, in
	which case they end on the same four spots, or a 1x4 perpendicular to
	the original center 1x4. In the latter case, the resulting 1x4s are
	also distorted, with the halves of each 1x4 that are closest to the
	center of the square offset in the same direction that the members of
	their group were offset in the original center 1x4, and forming a box
	with each other.</p>
