<h2>Grand Mix / Grand Swing and Mix / Grand 1/4 (or 3/4) Mix</h2>

<span class="Part1">Center pairs of dancers (3 pairs from an 8-dancer Tidal

 &quot;Grand Cross Run&quot;
	means that the dancers in each pair do a Run into a once-removed
	spot, on the far side of the other dancer in their own pair, as if
	they were the center pair of their own 4-person Line. Ends in a Tidal Line.

	<b>Teaching Notes</b> From an 8-dancer line, the second part is
	simply Triple Trade. Some dancers find it easier to think about the
	first part as Center pairs trade (typically Triple Trade), and all
	Spread. So, when getting the correct part division is not an issue,
	from an eight-dancer line the call can be thought of as Triple Trade,
	all Spread, and Triple Trade. Note, however, that this will not give
	the correct rolling direction for the very ends.

<h3>Grand Swing and Mix</h3>

	can, Right Arm Turn 1/4 (or 3/4), then all do the parts of a Grand
	Mix. Ends in a Tidal Line.</p>
