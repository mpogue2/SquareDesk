<h2>Checker Board/Box</h2>
<div class="parts"><b>CONCEPT</b></div>

		<p>From a 2x4 (or other applicable formations) with precisely two
			dancers in each 1x4 oriented as Leaders in Lines. In the following
			diagrams, &quot;L&quot; designates the Leaders in each Line as &quot;O&quot; designates
			the other dancers. The dancers designated by &quot;O&quot; can be oriented in
			any direction other than the same direction as the dancers designated
			&quot;L&quot; in their own 1x4.</p>

</p>

<h3>Checker Board &lt;anything&gt;</h3>
<p>The Leaders in each Line (“L” dancers) Trade with each other 
as the others (“O” dancers) do the &lt;anything&gt; call working in a distorted 1x4. Ends in a 2x4.</p>

	Note that although the four dancers start in a distorted 1x4, the
	result of the
	&lt;anything&gt; call may be some other four-person formation,
	such as a 2x2 or a Diamond, but they still end in the same four spots
	(e.g., as a distorted 2x2).

<div class="teaching-tip"><b>Teaching Notes</b> For both Checker Board
			and Checker Box, the dancers doing the trade typically move toward
			their new locations and point at the other spots as a way of helping
			the other dancers keep track of the spots where they should be ending
			up. While in principle the other dancers are doing their call
			&quot;working in&quot; that set of four spots (which doesn’t change as a result
			of the trade by the Leaders), and for simple calls it is best that
			they do it that way, for many calls they will find it easier to first
			form a non-distorted 1x4 or box, do the call, and then slide back
			into the original spots. In these cases, especially, such &quot;pointing&quot;
			can be very helpful. In these cases the dancers doing the trade will
			also typically stand back slightly, to leave room for the others to
			finish their call, before assuming their final positions.
