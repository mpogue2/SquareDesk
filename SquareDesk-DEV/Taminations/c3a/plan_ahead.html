	1/4, Cross Concentric Vertical Tag the Line, the Leaders Peel Left
	and the Trailers Peel Right to end as couples facing in (as in Sets
	In Motion). Outsides move forward around the outside, passing right
	shoulders with the first other Outside dancer, and taking right hands
	with the second; they then Hinge and Cross Concentric Vertical 1/2
	Tag into the center, and Face In. Facing Lines ends in a Double Pass
