<title>(Couples/Tandem/Siamese) Twosome &lt;anything&gt;</title>
</head>
<body><div class="definition">
<h2>(Couples / Tandem / Siamese) Twosome &lt;anything&gt;</h2>
<div class="parts"><b>CONCEPT</b></div>

<p>From formations with pairs of adjacent dancers facing the same
	direction: Do the given call with each pair of dancers acting as a
	unit, as in As Couples, Tandem, or Siamese, but with the members of
	each pair moving individually and maintaining a constant displacement
	from each other (staying the same distance and the same direction
	from each other, e.g., if one is closer to the caller and the other
	further from the caller, they remain so). The pairs may start as any
	mix of couples and tandems. If the pairing is ambiguous, the concept
	must be specified as &quot;Couples Twosome&quot;, &quot;Tandem Twosome&quot;, 
	or &quot;Siamese Twosome&quot; as appropriate. If the pairing is unambiguous, &quot;Twosome&quot;
	alone is sufficient. As in As Couples, Tandem, and so on, the dancers
	in each pair remain adjacent throughout the call and do not allow any
	other dancers to pass between them. Note: If the call causes a pair
	to turn an odd number of quarters (e.g., 1/4, 3/4), a couple will
	become a tandem, and vice versa.</p>

<div class="teaching-tip"><b>Teaching Notes</b> While this is not the
			definition, the basic action of Twosome Hinge is just a Follow Thru
			(Tandem Twosome) or a right- or left-handed 1/2 Tag (Couples
			Twosome). Many calls can be danced as combinations of this action.
