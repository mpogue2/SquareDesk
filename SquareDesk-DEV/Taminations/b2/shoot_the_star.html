<div class="comments"><b>Comment</b>
    <p>The Facing Couples Rule does not apply to this call.</p>
    <p>After Shoot the Star, the caller sometimes indicates that
      dancers are to Pull By one or more times and Arm Turn into another
      Thar. For instance, in the second command example above, following
      the Step Thru the dancers Right Pull By and, stepping up to a left
      forearm hold, Left Arm Turn 1/2.</p>
    <p>The caller can direct the dancers to Go Forward any number of
      hands. Each hand is a Pull By, except the last hand, which is
      normally the start of an Arm Turn into a Thar or Wrong Way Thar.</p>
    <p>Some callers use &quot;Forward&quot; to mean &quot;in normal Right and Left
      Grand direction&quot; and use &quot;Backward&quot; (or &quot;Back&quot; or &quot;Backwards&quot;) to
      mean the opposite direction. Other callers use &quot;Forward&quot; to mean &quot;the
      direction you are facing&quot; and never use the words &quot;Back&quot; or
      &quot;Backward&quot;. Either is acceptable, but callers must be careful not to
      confuse dancers. See the fourth and fifth command examples above.</p>
    <p>Some callers adapt Shoot the Star as a way to Cast Off 3/4 and
      get an Alamo Ring, e.g., &quot;Shoot The Star 3/4 To An Alamo Ring&quot; or
      simply &quot;Shoot The Star To An Alamo Ring&quot;. Shoot the Star can also
      blend into the next call, e.g., &quot;Shoot The Star, 4 Ladies Chain.&quot;</p>
