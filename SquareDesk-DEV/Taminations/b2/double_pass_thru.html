<h2>Double Pass Thru</h2>

<div class="full">
<p>Starting formation - double pass thru. Dancers move
forward, passing right shoulders with two other dancers to finish facing away from the
center of the set in a completed double pass thru formation. </p>
<p class="styling">STYLING: Same as in pass thru. Dancer leads slightly with right shoulder and therefore the lady could use her right hand to work her skirt by putting it in front of her as she passes.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: 4 steps.</p>
