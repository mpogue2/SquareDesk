<h2>Trade Family</h2>

<h3>Trade</h3>
		<div class="starting-formations">
			<b>Starting formations</b> Mini-Wave, Couple, and non-adjacent
			dancers, as described below
		</div>
		<div class="command-examples">
			<b>Command examples</b>
			<p>Centers Trade</p>
			<p>Boys Trade</p>
			<p>Ends Trade</p>
			<p>Heads Square Thru 4, Touch 1/4, Girls Trade</p>
			<p>Center 6, Trade</p>
		</div>
		<div class="dance-action">
			<b>Dance action</b> Two dancers exchange places by walking forward in
			a semicircle, passing right shoulders if they start facing the same
			direction. (See "General: Conventions and Rules: Passing Rule".)
			Dancers end facing the opposite direction from their original facing
			directions.

			<b>Ending formations</b> Mini-Wave, Couple, and non-adjacent dancers,
			as described below

			<p>From a Mini-Wave, dancers maintain their handhold.</p>
			<p>From a Couple, dancers swing their joined hands backward
				slightly as they release their handhold. This gets them turning in
				the correct direction as they start moving forward.</p>
		</div>

			<b>Comments</b>
			<p>Two dancers may Trade only when they are facing the same or
				opposite directions. Additionally, each dancer must be directly to
				the right or left of the other, but they do not need to be adjacent.</p>
			<p>Trade, when used without designating dancers, means Everyone
				Trade.</p>
			<p>Callers sometimes use helping words with this call. For
				example, from normal Facing Lines, &quot;Pass Thru, Girls Trade down the
				line&quot; alerts the women that they are not adjacent. Another example
				is &quot;Trade by the Right&quot; (or Left), which indicates that each pair of
				dancers who Trade are in a Right-Hand (or Left-Hand) Mini-Wave. In
				certain cases, helping words are necessary to designate pairs (e.g.,
				from an Alamo Ring, Trade by the Right) or designate dancers (e.g.,
				from an Inverted Line, Those Who Can Trade by the Left). Callers
				should be aware that sometimes (principally outside English-speaking
				countries) dancers may mistake &quot;Trade by the Right&quot; for the call
				Trade By (#49). In such a situation, &quot;Trade with the right hand&quot; may
				be more successful.</p>
			<p>For this call, when there are exactly four dancers who are
				directly right or left of one another, e.g., Heads Pass the Ocean,
				Extend, Everyone Trade, then the dance action is completed
				separately by each outside dancer with the nearby inside dancer.
				Similarly, if six or eight dancers Trade who are directly right or
				left of one another, then pairs of dancers Trade, where the pairs
				are determined working from the outside toward the center. For
				example, consider Heads Lead Right, Pass the Ocean, Girls Trade,
				Boys Trade. In each Trade, dancers are paired on each side. Helping
				words can also make this clear, e.g., &quot;Each Side, Boys Trade&quot;. Also
				see &quot;General: Ways of Naming Dancers: Centers / Ends&quot;.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="comments">
			<b>Comments</b>
			<p>It is common to use Partner Trade rather than Trade for a
				Couple, but both have the same effect. Using Partner Trade helps
				dancers anticipate passing right shoulders.</p>
			<p>Partner Trade is improper when the dancers are not adjacent.</p>
			<p>In 2017, the Mainstream Committee voted to restrict Partner
				Trade to start from a Couple only.</p>

<h3>Couples Trade</h3>
		<div class="starting-formations">
			<b>Starting formations</b> Two-Faced Line, One-Faced Line, and

			Line, center dancers also maintain their handhold.

			<p>Two Couples may Trade only when they are facing the same or
				opposite directions. Additionally, each Couple must be directly to
				the right or left of the other, but they do not need to be adjacent.
				If there are four Couples that are directly right or left of one
				another, then the dance action is completed separately by each
				outside Couple with the nearby inside Couple.</p>
			<p>Callers may use helping words, e.g. &quot;Couples Trade by the
				right&quot;. See the comments for 36.a. Trade.</p>
