<h2>Ocean Wave Family</h2>
<div class="abbrev">
<p class="abbrev">Ocean wave is a formation of three or more dancers
holding adjacent hands and with each dancer facing in an opposite direction to that of the
adjoining dancer(s).</p>

<ul>
<li><b>MINI WAVE</b> is an ocean wave consisting of two dancers.</li>

<li><b>RIGHT HAND WAVE</b>: An ocean wave with an even number of dancers is a right-hand wave if the end dancers
and the dancers adjacent to them have right hands joined.</li>

<li><b>LEFT HAND WAVE</b>: An ocean
wave with an even number of dancers is a left-hand wave if the end dancers and the dancers
adjacent to them have left hands joined.</li>

<li>
<b>ALAMO STYLE WAVE</b>: Alamo style is a formation
of an even number of dancers in a circle holding adjacent hands and with each dancer
facing in an opposite direction to that of the adjoining dancers.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="full">
<p>The Ocean Wave Family groups together two of the simplest calls
 that relate to the formations of Mini-Waves, Ocean Waves, and Tidal Waves.</p>
<p>Note: &quot;Ocean Wave&quot; refers to a 4-dancer formation. 
See &quot;Appendix A: Formations: 4-Dancer Formations&quot;. 
Terms such as &quot;Wave of 3&quot; or &quot;Wave of 6&quot; must be used for similar formations 
with other numbers of dancers.</p>

Dancers should use hands-up position. Forward distance between dancers should
be determined by the arm position of the dancer which is extended forward and
bent slightly at the elbow. Care should be taken not to pull down on the partner's arm.

Hands should never come behind the shoulders. Step forward touch, step back touch.
Or, as a pleasing variation, use a two-step (step, close, step, hold) forward
and a two-step (step, close, step, hold) back. Hands may be used to resist
forward motion to prevent stepping through too far.
