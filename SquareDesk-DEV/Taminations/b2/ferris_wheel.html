<div class="styling full"><b>Styling</b>
<p>All dancers use couple handholds. The in-facing couples should walk forward enough that they
could form a Two-Faced Line in the center before starting their Wheel And Deal. The dance action
should be a forward and wheeling action, not a bending and sweeping action.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for the couples to touch adjacent hands
in the momentary two-faced line, but some
popular styling variations do involve touching or slapping hands.</p>
<p>The timing works best if the out-facing couple adjusts their speed
so that everyone finishes at the same
time.</p></div>

<div class="styling abbrev"><b>Styling</b>
All dancers use couple handholds. The infacing couples should not start their
Wheel And Deal until they form a momentary Two-Faced Line. The dance action
should be a forward and wheeling action, not a bending and sweeping action.

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>As originally defined, there were other starting formations
for Ferris Wheel (Facing Lines, 1/4 Line),
but those variations have never been part of the CALLERLAB program.</p>

<p>From the formation Two-Faced Lines plus the couple looking in Bend The Line,
the call Ferris Wheel is proper.
This application is uncommon. Each Couple does their part.</p>

<p>The phrase &quot;Ferris Wheel And Deal&quot; is improper.</p></div>
