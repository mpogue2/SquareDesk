<h2>Extend</h2>

<div class="full">
<p>Extend involves dancers moving forward from one tagging formation to the next. There are five eight-dancer tagging
formations, which, in order, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Double Pass Thru (Zero Tag)</li>
<li>1/4 Tag</li>
<li>Ocean Waves (1/2 Tag)</li>
<li>3/4 Tag</li>
<li>Completed Double Pass Thru (Full Tag)</li>
</ol>

<p>This call was originally named &quot;Extend the Tag&quot;.
In 1988, the name was shortened to &quot;Extend&quot;, without changing the dance action.</p>
<div class="starting-formations"><b>Starting formations</b> The first four eight-dancer tagging formations (i.e., Double Pass Thru, 1/4 Tag, Ocean Waves,
and 3/4 Tag) and the corresponding four-dancer tagging formations, which are described below</div>
<div class="command-examples"><b>Command example</b>
<p>Extend</p></div>
<div class="dance-action"><b>Dance action</b> Walk forward from one tagging formation to the next. Where possible, handedness is maintained, as
described in the comments below.</div>
<div class="ending-formation"><b>Ending formations</b> The last four eight-dancer tagging formations (i.e., 1/4 Tag, Ocean Waves, 3/4 Tag, and
Completed Double Pass Thru) and the corresponding four-dancer tagging formations, which are described below.</div>
<div class="timing"><b>Timing</b>2</div>
<div class="styling"><b>Styling</b> All dancers should have their hands in ready dancing position for the formation resulting from the call
(couple handhold or Ocean Wave hand position).</div>
<div class="comments"><b>Comments</b> <p>The three middle tagging formations (i.e., 1/4 Tag, Ocean Waves, and 3/4 Tag) are either right- or lefthanded,
as determined by the handedness of the Ocean Wave or Ocean Waves. From a 1/4 Tag or Ocean Waves,
dancers walk forward to the ending formation that has the same handedness as the starting formation. From a
Double Pass Thru, the resulting 1/4 Tag is right-handed.</p>
<p>When the starting formation is left-handed, callers sometimes give helpful words, e.g., &quot;Extend to Left-Hand
Waves&quot;. It is improper to use Extend to change handedness, e.g., &quot;Heads Pass the Ocean, Extend to Left-Hand
Waves&quot;.</p>
<p>From a 1/4 Tag, "Centers Extend" or "Centers Extend To The Outsides" should not be used, because those phrases
wrongly imply that only the centers are active or that only the centers move. Everyone is active and everyone
moves.</p>
<p>Asking only some of the dancers to Extend (e.g., Heads Pass The Ocean, Just The Boys Extend) is considered a
Gimmick (see "Additional Detail: Commands: Gimmicks"). Another gimmick would be Head Ladies Chain 3/4,
Lines of 3 Touch 1/4, All Extend (to a Column).</p>
<p>Extend is improper from Facing Lines or a Tidal Wave. From these formations, callers should use Step To A
Wave or Step Thru (or Pass Thru, if a Right-Hand Tidal Wave) to have all dancers step forward.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Using Extend as a four-dancer call</span>: Although Extend is usually called to all eight dancers, it is actually a fourdancer
call related to the position of dancers as they Tag the Line. The dance action, timing, styling, and
comments also apply to these four-dancer tagging formations. Such applications are rarely encountered at
Mainstream and would probably require a workshop.</p>

</p>
<p>Note: A 1/4 (or 3/4) Tag formation is the same as two side-by-side Single 1/4 (or 3/4) Tag formations, because
outside dancers move together to become a couple. See &quot;Additional Detail: Dance Action: Square Breathing&quot;.</p>
<p>Extend is also proper (but quite unusual) from certain distorted Single 1/4 Tag formations where outside dancers
are facing the backs of the center dancers rather than facing the handhold of the Mini-Wave. For example, Ends
Fold and Everyone Extend is proper from an Ocean Wave but improper from a Two-Faced Line. For these
applications to be proper, dancers not in the usual position must begin in a Tandem with another dancer.</p>

<div class="dance-action"><b>Dance action</b>
Dancers in the wave release handholds and step forward to the couple they are
facing and form an ocean wave. If the original wave was right-handed, form a
right-hand wave. If the original wave was left-handed, form a left-hand wave.

All dancers move forward smoothly during the call. Use ocean wave styling.
</div>

<div class="teaching-tip"><b>Teaching Tip</b>
If you were a Center in the starting wave, you’ll be a Center in the ending wave.
If you were an End in the starting wave, you’ll be an End in the ending wave.
Stress that ALL dancers must move forward to keep the square from spreading out too far.
