  <p>The Facing Couples Rule applies to these calls.</p>
  <p>From a Tidal Wave, Swing Thru is danced in the Ocean Wave
    on each half; no dancers cross the center of the Tidal Wave.</p>
  <p>After applying the Facing Couples Rule, the starting
    formation of Swing Thru must be a Wave or an Alamo Ring
    (except for the extended application below). It is improper,
    for example, to Swing Thru from an Inverted Line.</p>
  <p>As an extended application, dancers can work in other
    groups, provided that after applying the Facing Couples Rule
    they are in a wave of three or more dancers. In this case, the
    caller must clearly tell those dancers to work together. For
    example, Heads Pass The Ocean; Extend; Boys Circulate 1 1/2;
    Girls Cast Off 3/4; In the Wave of 6, Swing Thru. To have
    eight dancers work together is especially tricky, and should
    be used only with great caution, since normally eight dancers
    work in two groups of four. The eight-dancer application is
    usually reserved for dance programs in which a different call
    [<a href="../plus/grand_swing_thru.html">Grand Swing Thru</a>]
    achieves this action.

All hands are joined in hands-up position, elbows in close. Exert slight
pressure to assist opposite dancer in turning. Arcing turns should be utilized
rather than pull by type of movements and should flow effortlessly from one
turn to the other so that you are in a sense, "weaving" along the line.
