<div class="comments full">
    <b>Comments</b>
    <p>When four couples are promenading and two couples Wheel
      Around, extra action is required. For example, in &quot;Promenade, Keep
      Walking; Heads Wheel Around&quot;, the Sides stop promenading while the
      Heads Wheel Around, and all adjust to Facing Lines. Some callers
      teach that Sides stop promenading when facing Head or Side walls
      so that the final formation faces those walls squarely without
      further adjustment.</p>
    <p>See &quot;Preface: Ways Of Naming Dancers: Heads / Sides&quot; for more
      details about naming dancers to Wheel Around from a promenade.</p>
    <p>The variation of this call in which dancers turn in the other
      direction is called Reverse Wheel Around. See &quot;Additional Detail:
      Commands: Extensions like Reverse Wheel Around&quot;.</p>
</div>

<div class="teaching-tip"><b>Calling Tip</b>
Wheel Around can be easier and more successful for the dancers if the
preceding call produces appropriate body flow.
</div>

<div class="teaching-tip"><b>Teaching Tip</b>
Wheel Around is like a Courtesy Turn without using the Courtesy Turn handhold.
