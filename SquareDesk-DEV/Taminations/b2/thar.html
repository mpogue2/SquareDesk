  <h2>Thar Family</h2>

  <div class="full">
  <p>In the Thar Family, Thars and Wrong Way Thars are formations in
    motion. Center dancers hold a Pack-saddle Star (see &quot;Additional
    Detail: Styling&quot;) and walk backward, and each center dancer
    maintains a forearm grip with the adjacent outside dancer, who walks
    forward.</p>

  <p>The calls in the Thar Family are some of the oldest. They are
    traditionally delivered in a more verbose fashion, blurring the
    division between the actual command words and the helping words. As
    always, it is the callerâ€™s responsibility to deliver these calls so
    the dancers understand what is desired.</p>

  <p>Timing numbers in the Thar Family do not count turning the Thar.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Allemande Thar</h3>

  <p class="full">&quot;Allemande Thar&quot; is a formation. It also appears on
    the Basic list of calls, not as a call by itself, but rather as a
    collection of commands that result in a Thar. The commands function as
    suffixes, making a Left Arm Turn end in a Thar. Descriptive words are
    often part of these commands.</p>

<div class="dance-action abbrev"><b>Dance action</b>
An Allemande Thar star is a formation and may be formed at the end of any
left arm turn by the center dancers (or those directed) forming a
right hand box star and backing up. Each outside dancer holds the
left forearm of a center dancer and dances forward.

<p>The dancers in the center, backing up, will form a Pack-saddle Star. These center dancers must remember to allow those on the outside, who travel farther, to set the pace.</p>
<p>Women, if on the outside, may use skirt work.</p></div>

<div class="styling abbrev"><b>Styling</b>
If all centers are men, their right hands will form a packsaddle/box star
where each man takes the wrist of the man in front of him. If any women
are in the center, all centers will simply touch hands in the center star.
The dancers forming the star must remember to allow those on the outside
to set the pace, since they have to travel a much further distance.
If the centers move too fast, the result is that those on the outside will
have to run to maintain the pace. As in any star, the ladies, while on the
outside, may elect to hold their skirts. The men should NOT grip or squeeze
the wrist of the one in front of them and they should not pump the arms up and down.
</div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
  <p>Callers often specify who ends in the center. This is
    particularly helpful in non-standard applications.</p>

  <p>In most cases, dancers Left Arm Turn 1/2. That is, if the
    dancers take forearm holds when shoulder-to-shoulder, the dancer who
    begins on the outside will end in the center. Callers may specify a
    different amount of turning. For example: Circle Left, Turn Your
    Corner Left All The Way Around To An Allemande Thar, Men In The
    Center.</p>

  <p>Allemande Thar is part of circle choreography. It is improper
    from Left Hand Waves to call Turn Partner Left to An Allemande Thar.</p>

  <p>&quot;Allemande Left to an Allemande Thar&quot; has a specific meaning
    described below (#32.b). It does not mean to Left Arm Turn with corner
    and continue to a Thar. For that action &quot;Allemande Left, Hang On To
    Corner, Women Wheel In To An Allemande Thar&quot; could be used.</p>
</div>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Calling Tips</b>
One common usage is Walk Around the Corner, Do Paso, Men wheel into an Allemande Thar.
</div>

<p class="abbrev">After a SHOOT THE STAR, the caller can say &quot;TO ANOTHER THAR&quot;.
This is the same action as &quot;TO AN ALLEMANDE THAR&quot; above. All right pull by and
left arm turn 1/2 the next to an ALLEMANDE THAR. The caller will almost always
direct &quot;Go Forward 2&quot;.</p>
<p class="abbrev">The caller can direct FORWARD (everyone progressing in
normal Right And Left Grand direction) or BACK or BACKWARD (everyone going
the opposite direction from a normal Right And Left Grand) any number of hands.
For example, &quot;Shoot the Star Full Turn, Go Backward 3, Right, Left, Right,
Men swing in make a Wrong Way Thar&quot;.</p>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Calling Tips</b>
To avoid confusion with the call &quot;ALLEMANDE THAR&quot; or &quot;MAKE A THAR&quot;, the caller
almost always says words like &quot;Allemande Left to an Allemande Thar, go forward 2,
men swing in with a backup star&quot; or &quot;Allemande Left, go Allemande Thar,
with a right and left and the 4 men star&quot;.

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
    <p>To avoid dancer confusion with Allemande Thar, the
      caller must always include some instructions about &quot;going forward&quot;.
      Simply calling &quot;Allemande Left To An Allemande Thar&quot; is improper.
      Furthermore, although going forward two is most common, it must be
      specified.</p>
    <p>The caller can direct the dancers to Go Forward any number of
      hands. Each hand is a Pull By, except the last hand, which is
      normally the start of an Arm Turn into a Thar or Wrong Way Thar.</p>
</div>


<h3>Wrong Way Thar</h3>

<p class="full">&quot;Wrong Way Thar&quot; is a formation. It also appears on the Basic
    list of calls, not as a call by itself, but rather as a collection of
    commands that result in a Wrong Way Thar. The commands function as
    suffixes, making a Right Arm Turn end in a Wrong Way Thar. Descriptive
    words are often part of these commands.</p>
