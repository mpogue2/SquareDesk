<div class="styling full"><b>Styling</b>
The 3-part definition is smoothed out. The left-side dancers walk in a forward arc to the right to
their ending position. The right-side dancers walk forward to join left hands (hands up styling) and
turn 1/4 with each other.</div>

<div class="styling abbrev"><b>Styling</b>
The Pass Thru portion of the call uses the same styling as Pass Thru.
The Step to a Wave portion of the call uses ocean wave styling.
</div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>The application of the Ocean Wave Rule to this call is not used at Basic and Mainstream. It
may be applied in the other programs.</p>
<p>Even though the styling encourages a smoothed out dance action, the definition of Pass The Ocean has
three distinct parts and callers may take advantage of this in their choreography.</p>
<p>This call should not be fractionalized at Basic and Mainstream.</p>
