<p>Each couple works as a unit. Wheel and Deal is danced as one smooth motion, even though the descriptions below break the motion into two parts.</p>
<p>From a Two-Faced Line: Each couple steps forward and then wheels 180 degrees toward the center of the line, with the original center dancers acting as the pivots about which the couples turn. Couples end facing each other.</p>
<p>From a One-Faced Line: The couple on the left steps forward. Then each couple wheels 180 degrees toward the center of the original line, with the original center dancers acting as the pivots about which the couples turn. The couple that started on the right ends in front of the other couple.</p></div>

<div class="comments"><b>Comments</b>
<p>To assist in understanding this call, here are some helpful facts:</p>
<ul><li> Dancers turn toward the center of the line (like Bend the Line, but unlike Wheel Around, which is always toward the left)</li>
<li>Each couple ends facing the opposite direction from which they started</li>
<li>From a One-Faced Line
<ul><li>The couple on the right ends in front</li>
<li>The couples pass right shoulders (of the right-hand dancers)</li></ul>
</ul>
<p>From a One-Faced Line, a more accurate dance action for the couple on the right
would be to step forward after the turn. So from a Tidal Line, Wheel And Deal ends
in Two-Faced Lines. Because of square breathing
(see &quot;Additional Detail: Dance Action: Square Breathing&quot;),
this step forward for Wheel And Deal is even more pronounced from
Lines Facing In, but unnecessary from Lines Facing Out.</p></div>

<h3>Wheel and Deal (from lines of four)</h3>
<div class="starting-formations"><b>Starting formation</b>
Line of four dancers facing the same direction
</div>

<div class="dance-action"><b>Dance action</b>
The left-hand couple takes a small step forward. The couples wheel 180&deg;
toward the center of the line with the center dancers of the line acting
as the pivot point about which a couple turns. The couple that started on
the right half of the line wheels in front of the other couple.
</div>

<div class="ending-formation"><b>Ending formation</b>
Tandem couples. Both couples end facing the same direction with the
original right hand couple in front of the original left hand couple.
</div>

<div class="timing"><b>Timing</b>4</div>

<div class="styling"><b>Styling</b>
Use couple handholds. The center dancers are the pivot point and should exert
slight pressure to assist in the wheel around movement. Forearms should be
adjacent to each other to assist in the wheeling action.
</div>

<div class="teaching-tip"><b>Teaching Tip</b>
Always go toward the other couple, never away from them.
</div>

Each couple steps slightly ahead. Each couple then wheels (180&deg;)
toward the center of the line with the center dancer of each couple
acting as the pivot point about which the couples turn.
