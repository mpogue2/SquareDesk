<title>Facing Couples Rule</title>
</head>
<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Facing Couples Rule</h2>

<p>A few specific calls that are defined to start from an Ocean Wave
are also proper starting from Facing Couples.
Examples include <a href="swing_thru.html">Swing Thru</a> and
<a href="../ms/spin_the_top.html">Spin The Top</a>.
In these cases, the dancers first step into a momentary Right-Hand Ocean Wave
and complete the call.</p>

<p>If the caller directs a left hand call
(e.g., <a href="swing_thru.html?LeftSwingThrufromFacingCouples">Left Swing Thru</a>),
the dancers first step into a momentary Left-Hand Ocean Wave.</p>

<p>If the Facing Couples rule is applicable, the call's definition
will have a comment to that effect.
If there is no such comment, then the Facing Couples rule may not be used.</p>

<p>While the rule is called the Facing Couples Rule,
it is generalized to include Facing Dancers stepping to a Right-
Hand Mini-Wave and Facing Lines step to a Right-Hand Tidal Wave, etc.</p>

<p>The following types of mixed Mini-Wave and Facing Dancer starting formations,
while unusual, are also proper:</p>
