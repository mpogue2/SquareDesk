<title>Ocean Wave Rule</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="definition">
    <h2>Ocean Wave Rule</h2>

<p>Some calls that are defined to start from Facing Couples are
  also proper starting from a Right-Hand Ocean Wave. Examples
  include <a href="../b1/right_and_left_thru.html">Right And Left Thru</a>
  and <a href="../b1/square_thru.html">Square Thru</a>. In these cases, the
  dancers have already stepped forward toward the facing dancer and
  are ready to complete the remaining action of the directed call.</p>

<p>For the sake of dancer comprehension and teaching purposes,
  it may be necessary initially to have the dancers back up into
  facing couples, then step back into the wave and complete the
  call.</p>

<p>While the rule is called the Ocean Wave Rule, it is
  generalized to include Mini-Wave (Facing Dancers) and Tidal Wave
  (Facing Lines), etc. Examples include <a href="../b1/pass_thru.html">Pass Thru</a>,
  <a href="../ms/slide_thru.html">Slide Thru</a>,
  <a href="box_the_gnat.html">Box The Gnat</a>,
  and <a href="double_pass_thru.html">Double Pass Thru</a> (from a Right-Hand 1/4 Tag), and
  <a href="../ms/pass_to_the_center.html">Pass To The Center</a> (from Right-Hand Ocean Waves).</p>

<p>In order for the Ocean Wave Rule to apply, the initial dance
  action of the call must start with a Box The Gnat, Pass Thru, or
  Right Pull By. In addition, the call must not be defined to have a
  different dance action from an Ocean Wave. For example, the call
  Circulate is defined from Eight Chain Thru and from Ocean Waves.
  It would be improper to call <a href="../b1/circulate.html">Circulate</a>
  from Ocean Waves and expect
  dancers to dance it as a Step Thru based on the Ocean Wave Rule
  because they would naturally apply the definition of Circulate
  from Ocean Waves.</p>

<p>The following mixed Mini-Wave and Facing Dancer starting
  formation, while unusual, is also proper:</p>

</p>

<p>The adjustment that is part of the Ocean Wave Rule does not
  change the effect of the call. It neither adds nor subtracts parts
  or changes the use of fractions. It is as if any dancer in a
  mini-wave had first stepped back into facing dancers and then all
  did the call. For example, from a Right-Hand Mini-Wave
  <a href="../b1/dosado.html">Dosado</a> ends
  in Facing Dancers, not in a Right-Hand Mini-Wave.</p>

<p>The Ocean Wave Rule also applies to calls that normally start
  from Facing Couples when the dancers are in a Left Hand Ocean
  Wave. In these cases, the caller must direct a left hand call
  (e.g., Left Square Thru). See "Additional Detail: Commands:
  Extensions like Reverse Wheel Around".</p>

<p>When half of the dancers are in a Mini-Wave, and the other
  half of the dancers are Facing Dancers, and the call is a 2-dancer
  call (e.g., Box The Gnat, Slide Thru, Pass Thru) the caller should
  make clear who is to do the call (e.g., Everyone or Those Facing).</p>

<p class="timing">Timing: Application of the Ocean Wave Rule
  does not change the timing of the call.</p>
