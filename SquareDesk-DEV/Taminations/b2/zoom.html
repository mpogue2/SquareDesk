<h2>Zoom</h2>

<p>In this definition, the term &quot;center point&quot;
refers to the center of the 4-dancer formation on your side of the
set, or the center of the whole set, if you are not part of a 4-dancer formation.</p>

<div class="starting-formations"><b>Starting formations</b>

<p>Lead dancers hold arms in natural dance position.
For women, skirt work is optional. When the
trailing dancers form a Couple, they maintain a couple handhold.</p>
<p class="full">It is important that the lead dancers initiate the roll out movement
with a slight forward motion to
allow sufficient room for the trailing dancers to step forward comfortably.</p></div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>Unlike Run or Fold, Zoom does not require naming or activating the leaders (except from a
Promenade - see below). While this may seem to be helpful, it often makes it unclear who should be
active. Suggested helping words are &quot;Zoom, Leaders go back&quot;.
See the sections &quot;Additional Detail: Centers Zoom&quot; and
&quot;Additional Detail: Extra words&quot;.</p>
<p>It is acceptable to call Zoom to dancers on the outside of the square who form a Tandem (e.g., from
Ocean Waves or Two-Faced Lines, Ends Zoom).</p>
<p>As a gimmick, some callers use Zoom while promenading, mainly as a way to convert an out-of-sequence
promenade into an in-sequence promenade. In this case, the dancers in a couple must be named and
they act as leaders and work with the couple following them in the promenade (e.g., Promenade, Keep
Walking; Heads Zoom; Promenade Home). Some callers feel that this is not smooth and that there isn't
enough room to properly perform the move.
Some callers feel that the proper command is &quot;Heads are leaders, All Zoom&quot;.</p>
<p>It is acceptable to call to call Zoom while Single File Promenading.
For example, &quot;Boys Are Leads, Boys Zoom&quot;
or simply &quot;Boys Zoom&quot;.</p>
