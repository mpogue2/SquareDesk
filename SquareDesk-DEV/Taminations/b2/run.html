<h2>Run / Cross Run</h2>
<div class="full">
<p>With these calls, the caller must designate certain
  dancers; generally half the dancers are designated. For this
  definition, a runner (or cross-runner) is a designated dancer
  and a non-runner is another dancer who moves during the call.
  For example, in Boys Run, the men are the runners and the women
  are the non-runners.</p>
<p>On Run, dancers work in pairs. On Cross Run, dancers work
  in groups of four, with the cross-runners crossing the center of
  the formation.</p>
<h3>Case 1: Run</h3>

<div class="command-examples"><b>Command examples</b>

<p>Centers Run</p>
<p>Women Run Right</p>
<p>Leaders Run</p>
</div>
<div class="dance-action"><b>Dance action</b>
<p> Each runner (designated dancer) must have a non-runner either to the right or to the left, 
and these dancers work together.</p>
<p>The runner and non-runner exchange places: the runner walks forward in a semicircle 
into the non-runner's spot (ending with the opposite facing direction), while the non-runner 
moves into the runner's spot without changing facing direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="ending-formation"><b>Ending formation</b> Couple, Mini-Wave</div>

(i.e., Couple or Mini-Wave).</div>
<div class="comments"><b>Comments</b>
  <p>A direction may be given, and this indicates where the
    non-runner is relative to the runner. It is often optional
    (e.g., Swing Thru, Boys Run Right), but may be required to
    avoid ambiguity (e.g., from an Alamo or Circle; or Heads
    Square Thru, Touch 1/4, Center Girls Run Left).</p>
  <p>Infrequently used applications of Run can ask the same
    designated dancers to run around successive people (e.g., End
    Boy Run Right, Left, and Right), or to remain designated for
    multiple calls (e.g., Girls Cross Run and then Run).</p>
  <p>An extended application designates more than one
    non-runner for each runner. E.g., from normal Lines Facing
    Out, End Boys Run Around 2. In this case, the center dancers
    are non-runners. The end boy walks in a semicircle to end in
    the position of the farther center while each non-runner moves
    one position toward where the runner started.</p>
  <p>Some callers occasionally use Everyone Run. For example,
    from Lines Facing Out, this would be equivalent to Partner
    Trade. Because each runner is not next to a non-runner, this
    application is a gimmick (see Additional Detail: Commands:
    Gimmicks). This gimmick may not be used if only some dancers
    are designated. For example, after Heads Pass the Ocean,
    Extend, Split Circulate, the call Boys Run is improper because
    it is unclear if the Girls should do the part of the
    non-runner or not move at all. To be proper, the caller could
    use Do Your Part (see Additional Detail: Commands: Do Your
    Part).</p>
  <p>At Mainstream, the runner and non-runner will almost
    always begin as a Mini-Wave or Couple. A workshop should
    precede other applications, such as when the non-runner is
    initially facing the shoulder of the runner (e.g., from a
    Double Pass Thru formation, Centers Square Thru 4, Centers
    Run).</p>

</div>
<div class="dance-action"><b>Dance action</b> 
<p>Dancers work in a 1x4 Formation, where the cross-runners (designated dancers) 
must both be centers or both be ends. The others are the non-runners.</p>
<p>The cross-runners walk forward in a semi-circle into the spot vacated by the 
farther non-runner (ending with the opposite facing direction). That is, each cross-runner
will cross the center of the four-dancer formation.</p>
<p>Simultaneously each non-runner moves into the spot of the closer cross-runner 
without changing facing direction. This position will be on their half of the four-dancer formation. 
That is, a center non-runner moves into the nearer end position; an end non-runner moves 
into the nearer center position.</p>

<div class="comments"><b>Comments</b> <p>From a Tidal Wave (or other 1x8 Formations), 
callers must carefully identify centers and ends. See the Tidal Wave command examples above and "General: Ways Of Naming Dancers: Centers / Ends".</p>
<p>If the cross-runners are centers facing the same way, they Half Sashay, 
blending into a Run around the original far end.</p>
<p>If the cross-runners are ends facing the same way, they pass right shoulders with each other.</p>
<p>From a General Line, Everyone Cross Run is a gimmick. 
See the second to last comment of Run, above.</p>
<p>At Mainstream, Cross Run will almost always be called from a General Line. 
For other applications, see the final comment of Run, above.</p>

<h2>Run / Cross Run</h2>
<h3>(Named Dancers) Run</h3>

<div class="starting-formations"><b>Starting formation</b>
Any two-dancer formation in which the directed dancer has a shoulder directly adjacent to the other dancer.
</div>

<div class="dance-action"><b>Dance action</b>
The directed (active) dancer moves forward in a semi-circle (180&deg;) around an
adjacent (inactive) dancer to end in the adjacent dancer's starting position.
Meanwhile, the inactive dancer, who may be facing in any direction, adjusts
by stepping (without changing facing direction) into the vacated starting
position of the active dancer. The active dancer doing the run has reversed
his/her original facing direction. If the direction to Run is not specified
(right or left) and if the active dancer has an inactive dancer on each side,
then centers Run around ends and ends Run around centers. Runs from an alamo
circle are to the right unless otherwise directed.
</div>

<div class="ending-formation"><b>Ending formation</b>
Various, depending on starting formation. The two dancers will have exchanged places.
</div>

<div class="timing"><b>Timing</b>4</div>

<div class="styling"><b>Styling</b>
Hands should blend into the handhold required for the ending formation.
</div>

<div class="teaching-tip"><b>Calling Tip</b>
Usually called from an Ocean Wave, Two-Faced Line, or Line as Boys Run, Girls Run, Ends Run or Centers Run.
</div>


<h3>(Named Dancers) Cross Run</h3>

<div class="starting-formations"><b>Starting formation</b>
Line, two-faced line, or wave.
</div>

<div class="dance-action"><b>Dance action</b>
Each of the two directed (active) dancers, who must both be either centers or
ends, Run into the spot vacated by the farthest inactive dancer. If the inactive
dancers are centers, they sidestep to become ends; if they are ends, they
sidestep to become centers. When the active dancers are both facing the same
direction, they move forward in a semi-circle, pass each other and then Run
into the vacated spot on the far side.
