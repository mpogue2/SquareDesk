<title>Three-Quarters Tag the Line</title>
</head>
<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Three-Quarters Tag the Line</h2>
<p>Starting formation - Parallel Lines of Four, Inverted Line(s),
Two Faced Line(s), 3 &amp; 1 Line(s). </p>
<p>Each dancer turns individually to face the center of the line and walks forward passing
right shoulders with oncoming dancers. Lead dancers pass by two dancers and end facing
out. Trailing dancers pass by one dancer and step to a right-hand Ocean Wave in the center
of the set. Ends in a 3/4 Tag formation. If the call is done from any single line of four,
it ends with a mini-wave between two out-facing dancers. </p>
<p class="styling">STYLING: Styling is similar to that previously described for the basic  tag the line. Trailing dancers blend into  hands up position for ocean wave or mini wave as dictated by starting formation.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: 5</p>
