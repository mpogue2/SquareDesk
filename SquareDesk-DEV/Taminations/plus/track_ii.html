<h2>Track Two</h2>
<p>Starting formation - Completed Double Pass Thru. </p>
<p>The dancers work in "tandem", that is, the trailing dancers follow the lead
dancers. Those in the right "track" move single file to the left,
counter-clockwise, staying to the inside of the dancers on the left "track", who
move single file, clockwise, to the right on the outside. The movement continues as in a
<a href="../b2/double_pass_thru.html">
Double Pass Thru</a>, until the dancers have reached parallel right-hand ocean waves. </p>
<p class="styling">STYLING: As dancers are moving simultaneously in opposing directions, it is important for them to provide moving room for one another. Those on the outside must avoid crowding those in the center. All dancers hold arms in  natural dance position, blending into a  hands up ocean wave formation at the conclusion of the call.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: 8</p>
