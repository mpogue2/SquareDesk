<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Flip the Diamond</h2>
<p>Starting formation - Any Diamond. </p>
<p>The centers of the diamond do a <a href="diamond_circulate.html"> Diamond Circulate</a> to the next position in their
diamond, while the points <a href="../b2/run.html">Run</a> ("Flip" 180&deg;) into the nearest center
position and join hands to become the centers of the forming wave or line. When
"flipping" a facing diamond, the points always take the inside path, and the
centers always take the outside path. </p>
<p class="styling">STYLING: From a normal diamond formation, all dancers blend into  hands up position as required for ocean wave basic. If the starting formation is a facing diamond, all dancers blend into a  couple handhold.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: 3</p>
