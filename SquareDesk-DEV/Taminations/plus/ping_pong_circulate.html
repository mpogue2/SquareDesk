<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Ping Pong Circulate</h2>
<p>Starting formation - Quarter Tag. </p>
<p>The movement starts and ends in a Quarter Tag formation. Each dancer Circulates, or
moves forward one position along the path shown in Figure 1. The movement may also be
called when there is a left-hand wave in the center. In this case, the path circulated
along is as shown in Figure 2. </p>
<p>It should be noted that the Circulate paths are independent of each other. Therefore,
it is possible for only those on the outside path (dancers numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 in Figures
1 &amp; 2) to Ping Pong Circulate or only those on the inside path (dancers numbered 5, 6,
7, &amp; 8 in Figures 1 &amp; 2) to Ping Pong Circulate. </p>
