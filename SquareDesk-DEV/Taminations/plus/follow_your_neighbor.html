<h2>Follow Your Neighbor</h2>
<p>Starting formation - Box Circulate. </p>


<p>From a Box Circulate: While the Trailers Extend and Arm Turn 3/4, the Leaders move forward in a tight
three quarter (270 degree) circle toward their partner to finish as ends of an ocean wave. Follow Your
Neighbor cannot be fractionalized.</p>
<p>From a Single 1/4 Tag: All dancers do the Trailers part (Extend and Arm Turn 3/4).</p>

<p>From a Right-Hand Box Circulate, Follow Your Neighbor ends in a Left-Hand Wave. From a Right-Hand
Single 1/4 Tag, Follow Your Neighbor ends in a Right-Hand Wave</p>


<p class="styling">STYLING: Those who Arm Turn 3/4 use a forearm grip,
blending at the end of the call into the usual handhold for an ocean wave.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: 6</p>
