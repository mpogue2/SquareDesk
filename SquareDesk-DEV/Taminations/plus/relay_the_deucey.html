<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Relay the Deucey</h2>
<p>Starting formation - Parallel Ocean Waves.</p>
<p>
      All Circulates in this definition refer to the
      <span style="text-decoration:underline">Original</span>
      Circulate path established by the ends of the original ocean
      waves. No dancer ever stops moving during this call; the pauses
      written into the definition (i.e., the action described as
      &quot;half-circulate&quot;) are there for clarity of description
      and for teaching purposes only.
    </p>
<p>

<span id="RelaytheDeucey1">
        Each end and the adjacent center dancer turn one-half
        (180&deg;)
      </span>
      .
      <span id="RelaytheDeucey2">
        The new centers of each ocean wave turn three-quarters
        (270&deg;), while the others half-circulate, forming a
        six-person wave and two lonesome dancers
      </span>
      .
      <span id="RelaytheDeucey3">
        The wave of six, working as 3 pairs, turns 180&deg;, while the others
        half-circulate
      </span>
      .
      <span id="RelaytheDeucey4">
        In the wave, the center 4 turn 180&deg;, while the other four dancers
        half-circulate.
      </span>
      <span id="RelaytheDeucey5">
        The wave of 6, again working as 3 pairs, turns 180&deg;, while the
        others half-circulate.
      </span>
      <span id="RelaytheDeucey6">
        Finally, the center 4 of the wave turn &frac34; (becoming the centers
        of the new waves), while the outside 4 half-circulate to become
        the ends of the final waves.
      </span>

</p>
<p class="styling">STYLING:
    Basic swing thru
    styling is utilized for turning movements within the ocean wave
    formations. Circulating dancers do the circulate action with arms in
    natural dance position,
    blending to hands up ocean wave formation at the conclusion of the
    call.
