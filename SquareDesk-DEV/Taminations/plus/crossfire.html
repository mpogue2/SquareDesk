<h2>Crossfire</h2>
<p>Starting formation - Two faced line, Parallel lines of four, Inverted Line(s). </p>
<p>As the centers begin to <a href="../b2/trade.html">Trade</a>, the ends <a href="../ms/fold.html"> Cross
Fold</a>. Upon completing their Trade, the
centers release hands and step straight forward forming an ocean wave or mini-wave with
the dancers they are facing. If the Trade leaves the original centers facing no one, they
step forward and remain facing out. </p>
<p class="styling">STYLING: If starting formation is a two-faced line, center dancers use  hands up position for trading action and blend into normal mini wave styling. If starting formation is parallel lines of four that results in centers facing no one, that couple joins hands with a  couple handhold.</p>
