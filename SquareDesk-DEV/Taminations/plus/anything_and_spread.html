<title>Anything and Spread</title>
</head>
<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Anything and Spread</h2>
<p>Starting formation - Various. </p>
<p>This call can be used in three ways: </p>
<ol>

<li>If only some of the dancers are directed to Spread (e.g., from a static square,
Heads Star Thru &amp; Spread), they slide apart sideways to become ends, as the inactive
dancers step forward between them.</li>

<li>If the (Anything) call finishes in lines or waves (e.g., Follow Your Neighbor), the
centers anticipate the Spread action by sliding apart sideways to become the new ends,
while the original ends anticipate the Spread action by moving into the nearest center
position.</li>

<li>If the (Anything) call finishes in tandem couples (e.g., Wheel &amp; Deal from a
line of four), the lead dancers slide apart sideways, while the trailing dancers step
forward between them.</li>

</ol>
<p class="styling">STYLING: All dancers blend into the appropriate hand position and styling
designated by the formation resulting at the conclusion of the call (e.g., ocean wave
styling after the call "Follow Your Neighbor and Spread").
</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: 2</p>
