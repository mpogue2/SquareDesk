<title>Chase Right</title>

<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Chase Right</h2>
<p>Starting formation - Two Couples Back-to-Back. </p>
<p>Each right-hand dancer does an exaggerated <a href="../b2/zoom.html"> Zoom</a> action, moving into the position
previously occupied by the right-hand dancer behind him, to finish facing in the same
direction as when he started the Zoom action. (The net result is the same as if the
right-hand dancer had done a right face <a href="../b1/turn_back.html"> U Turn Back</a> &amp;
<a href="../b1/circulate.html"> Box Circulate</a> twice). The
left-hand dancer follows ("Chases") the right-hand dancer by doing a
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="../b1/circulate.html">
Box Circulate</a> two positions</span>. The call finishes in a Box Circulate formation. </p>
<p class="styling">STYLING: All dancers have  arms in natural dance position. Ladies'  skirt work optional. Right hand dancer uses flowing motion rather than an abrupt turn around. When two couples (e.g., the heads) do chase right in the center of the square, it is important for those doing the zoom motion to keep the action tight and avoid bumping into the outside dancers. At the same time, those, not involved in the Chase Right, move, if possible and comfortable, away from the center to allow more space for the action.</p>
