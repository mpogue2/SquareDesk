<h2>Extend</h2>

<p><b>[ In 2016 Extend was moved to Basic 2 ]</b></p>

<p>Starting formation - Double Pass Thru, Parallel Ocean Waves
(1/2 Tag), any Tag (1/4 or 3/4) formation. </p>
<p>All dancers release handholds (if necessary), step forward and form an ocean wave with
the couple they are facing. If the Extend leaves dancers facing no one, they remain facing
out. If the starting formation is right-handed, dancers Extend to a right-handed
formation; if the starting formation is left-handed, dancers Extend to a left-handed
formation. From a Double Pass Thru formation, dancers Extend to a right-hand Quarter Tag
formation. From a Quarter Tag formation, dancers Extend to parallel waves. From parallel
waves, dancers Extend to a 3/4 Tag formation, from a 3/4 Tag formation, dancers Extend to
a completed Double Pass Thru formation. </p>
<p class="styling">STYLING: All dancers move forward smoothly during extending action. Dancers utilize previously described styling for resulting formations at the completion of the call (e.g., ocean wave styling, couple handhold for double pass thru formation, etc.)</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: 2</p>
