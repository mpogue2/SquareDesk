<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Dixie Grand</h2>
<p>Starting formation - Dixie Grand Circle, Double Pass Thru, Quarter
Tag, or any formation
<span style="text-decoration:underline">where at least two dancers can start</span>. </p>
<p>
<span id="Part1">Those who can, start the call by joining right hands
with the facing dancer and
pulling by.</span>
<span id="Part2">Each dancer moves ahead around the circle
and gives a left hand to the next, pulling by,</span>
<span id="Part3">and a right hand to the next, pulling by.</span>
Regardless of the starting
formation, as the movement progresses, the formation converts to a circle. </p>
<p class="styling">STYLING: Styling is similar to the description for the basic  right and left grand. Dancers use handshake hold for alternating  pull by movements, releasing hands as dancers pass each other. Skirt work is not recommended.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: 6</p>
