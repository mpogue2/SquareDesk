<p class="styling">STYLING: Dancers turning in ocean wave formations use styling as previously described for the basics  swing thru and  spin chain thru. For star portions of basic, refer to styling as indicated by the basic  star right. When turning into the star or out to the wave, use a flowing turn rather than an abrupt about-face. In star patterns, ladies' outside hands may be used to  work skirts.</p>
