<title>Invert the Column 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, Full</title>
</head>
<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Invert the Column 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, Full</h2>
<p>From columns: The #1 dancer in each column <a href="../plus/peel_off.html"> Peel Off</a> (away from the other
column) 180 degrees and walk forward as everyone else follows single file.
Finishes in columns close together (requiring an adjustment at the end). If the
caller gives a fraction, the number of 1/4s in the fraction indicates the number
of dancers who do the Peel Off action, while the remaining dancers <a href="../plus/extend.html"> Extend</a> once
for each 1/4. The columns balance themselves, so that they are mutually
centered. Thus, for Invert the Column 1/2: #1 does the Peel Off and #2 follows,
forming parallel waves with the #3 and #4 dancers, who move up one spot.</p>
