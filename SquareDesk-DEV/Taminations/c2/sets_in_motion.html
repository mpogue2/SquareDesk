<h2>Sets in Motion</h2>

<p>  From general lines in which the centers are not all facing in:
  Centers Hinge, then the new very centers Trade; all original centers
  Roll, making a Column of 4. Meanwhile, the original ends Circulate 1
  1/2 and any dancers who line up with the column of 4 Face In so the
  center column has four to eight dancers. The center column dancers,
  who must be facing the center of the set, walk forward, passing
  right shoulders, until the first dancers Peel Left and second
  dancers Peel Right, to finish as in-facing couples separated only by
  any other column dancers, who remain in the center and finish
  holding right hands with another center.

<p>If no outsides join the center column, then after the Peel Left and Peel Right, 
the final formation has Facing Couples in the center with Right-Hand Mini-Waves 
to their left and right.</p>
