<p>From anywhere a <a href="../b2/run.html"> Run</a> is possible, or from a single dancer: The designated
dancer does a <a href="../b2/run.html"> Run</a> around the adjacent vacant spot or dancer, who does not
move! The caller must designate a looping direction (right, left, in,
out), and must say how many people or spots to pass. For example: in
Right Loop 3 the looper moves to the right, passing 3 positions.</p>
