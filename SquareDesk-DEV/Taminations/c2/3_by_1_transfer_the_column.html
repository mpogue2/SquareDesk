<h2>3 by 1 Transfer The Column</h2>
<p>From columns: The first 3 dancers in each column do the Promenade part of <a href="../a1/transfer_the_column.html">
Transfer the Column</a>, and the #4 dancer <a href="../plus/extend.html"> Extend</a> (to meet the other #4 dancer),
<a href="../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.html">
Cast Off 3/4</a>, and <a href="../plus/extend.html">Extend</a>. Finishes in 3-and-1 lines. On the Extend, the lone
dancer steps to a mini-wave with the center of the outside threesome, using the
same hand used in the Cast.</p>
