<h2>Peel to a Diamond</h2>

  <p>Starting Formations: Box Circulate, Tandem Couples, or Tandem
    Dancers in a Z (e.g., after Ends Fold from a wave, or after Step and
    Slide from a two-faced line)</p>
  <p>Lead dancers do their part of a <a href="../plus/peel_off.html">Peel Off</a>.
  Trailing dancers step
    forward, if necessary, until shoulder-to-shoulder and then <a href="../ms/hinge.html">Hinge</a> with
    each other.</p>
  <p>The call is danced so the ending formation has the same center
    point as the starting formation. Box Circulate or the given Z examples
    end in a Facing Diamond. Tandem Couples end in a Funny Diamond.</p>
  <p>Peel to a Diamond cannot be fractionalized. Everyone can

    after a Peel to a Diamond.</p>
