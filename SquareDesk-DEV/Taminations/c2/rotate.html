<h2>Rotate 1/4, 1/2, 3/4</h2>
<p>From parallel lines, composed entirely of couples (e.g.
facing lines, two-faced lines) only: Each box of 4 of the
square works independently. As couples turn 1/4 toward
promenade direction (giving a left-hand two-faced line).
<i>That new line</i> does a Couples Hinge once for each 1/4 in
the fraction the caller gives (caller must give a fraction).</p>
