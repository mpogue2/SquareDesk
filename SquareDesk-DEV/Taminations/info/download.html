<h2>How to Download Taminations</h2>
<table width="100%" summary=""><tr valign="top"><td style="width:60%">
<p>
<b>If you are running Windows 10, try the new
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH5GGHH">Taminations App for Windows</a>
instead of using this download.</b>
</p>
<p>
Maybe you would like to use Taminations during your class, but your dance hall doesn't have
an Internet connection.  Not a problem!  You can download and run Taminations on your laptop.
</p>

<p>
To get all the the animations, download <a href="../tamination.zip">tamination.zip</a>
You will need to unzip the file after downloading it.  Find the file and
double-click on it, selecting the 'Extract all files' option.  Then you will have a
directory structure like the one shown to the right.
Load the tamination/index.html file into your browser
to go directly to the animations.
</p>

<p>To load the animations, the browser needs to read xml files that contain
the animation definitions.  Some browsers have problems reading local xml files
(i.e. not from the internet).  Here are some tips for specific browsers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer 10: Select "Allow blocked content" when prompted, then works ok</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 11: does NOT work</li>
<li>Firefox: works as is.  But you must start browsing at taminations/index.html
     or you will get errors trying to load some calls.</li>
<li>Chrome: needs to be run with the command-line option --allow-file-access-from-files.
    To set this up, right-click on the Chrome item in the Start menu and select Properties.
    Under the Shortcut tab, edit the Target line, adding --allow-file-access-from-files
    at the end, separated with a space.</li>
<li>Opera: does NOT work</li>
<li>Safari (Mac): does NOT work.  Use Firefox for Mac instead.</li>
<li>Safari (Windows): works as is, but no longer supported or updated by Apple.
    So I do not recommend this browser.</li>
</ul>
