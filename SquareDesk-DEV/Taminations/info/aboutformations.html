<h2>Formations</h2>

<p>
Every animation needs a starting formation.  The formation gives the number
of dancers, their gender, where they start, and which direction they are facing.
Here is the XML for a simple formation.
</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;formation name=&quot;Facing Couples&quot;&gt;
    &lt;dancer gender=&quot;boy&quot; x=&quot;-2&quot; y=&quot;1&quot; angle=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;dancer gender=&quot;girl&quot; x=&quot;-2&quot; y=&quot;-1&quot; angle=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/formation&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
Since the formations are always symmetrical, only the positions of 2 dancers are
needed for a 4-dancer formation.  The coordinate system is X pointing to the
top of the screen and Y to the left, with (0,0) at the center of the dance floor.
This is the same as a dancer's coordinates for a dancer at the center
facing the top of the screen.  A dancer facing the top of the screen has an
angle of 0 degrees, facing Y is 90 degrees.  For every dancer at (X,Y) with angle A the symmetrical
dancer is at position (-X,-Y) facing A+180 degrees.
</p>
<p>
Just like there are pre-defined moves, there are pre-defined formations
with names such as the above &quot;Facing Couples&quot;.  This name can be used
as the value of the <code>formation</code> attribute of the <code>tam</code> element.
Recall the XML for the Forward animation from the previous page.
This uses the named formation Couples Facing Out.
</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;tam title=&quot;Forward&quot; formation=&quot;Couples Facing Out&quot; group=&quot; &quot;&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;
      &lt;move select=&quot;Forward&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/path&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;
      &lt;move select=&quot;Forward&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/path&gt;
  &lt;/tam&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
The named formations are listed in the file <a href="formations.xml">formations.xml</a>.
If you need a formation not listed, it can be given as a formation element in
the animation.  Here is how the previous animation would look if there was no
named formation for Couples Facing Out.
</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;tam title=&quot;Forward&quot; group=&quot; &quot;&gt;
    &lt;formation&gt;
      &lt;dancer gender=&quot;girl&quot; x=&quot;-2&quot; y=&quot;1&quot; angle=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;dancer gender=&quot;boy&quot; x=&quot;-2&quot; y=&quot;-1&quot; angle=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/formation&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;
      &lt;move select=&quot;Forward&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/path&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;
      &lt;move select=&quot;Forward&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/path&gt;
  &lt;/tam&gt;

</code></pre>

<div style="float:left; margin:20px"><a href="movements.html">&lt;-- Prev</a></div>
