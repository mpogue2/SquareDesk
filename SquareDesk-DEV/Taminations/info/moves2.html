<h2>Move Attributes</h2>

<p>
Each move requires the <code>select</code> attribute, whose value is the name of
the move. Moves can also be modified with additional attributes.
These animations show how some of these attributes work.  Here is the XML
of the first animation.
</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;tam title=&quot;Lead Right scaleX=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&quot; formation=&quot;Couples Facing Out&quot; group=&quot;Lead Right&quot;&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;
      &lt;move select=&quot;Lead Right&quot; scaleX=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/path&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;
      &lt;move select=&quot;Lead Right&quot; scaleX=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/path&gt;
  &lt;/tam&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
The coordinates for these attributes are relative to the dancer's current
position and facing direction.  The X axis is forward and Y is to the left.
Attributes that modify the dancer's position are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>scaleX</b> and <b>scaleY</b>
    Multiply the destination coordinate by the given factor.
    The factor can be any real number.  You can make a move larger
    with a scale factor greater than 1, and make a move smaller
    with a scale value between 1 and 0.
</li>
<li><b>offsetX</b> and <b>offsetY</b>
    Add an offset to the destination coordinate.  This is useful for moves
    like Quarter Right, which are not affected by scale attributes.
    You can use both positive and negative real numbers, as shown in these examples.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Other move attributes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>beats</b>
    The number of beats to use for this move, a real number greater than 0.
    Every move has a default number of beats, and you use this attribute to
    override that value.
</li>
<li><b>hands</b>
    The hands that should be used to connect with other dancers.  Values are
    none, right, left, both, gripright, gripleft, gripboth.  For values
    right, left, and both, the program will look for another dancer looking
    for a hand within reach, and keep the connection as long as the dancers
    stay together.  The grip values are different in that once a connection
    is made the dancers will not let go until the end of the move, no matter
    how far apart.  See  <a href="../b1/dive_thru.html">Dive Thru</a>
    for an example of using grip values.
</li>
<li><b>reflect</b>
    This reflects the move around the dancer's X axis.  The effect is like
    using a scaleY value of -1, and changing the sign of any offsetY value.
    It also switches any right and left hand values.  The reflect attribute
    is used internally to create Right moves from Left moves without
    re-doing all the math.  Since Right and Left moves are both pre-defined
    you will not need tu use the reflect attribute
    unless defining your own moves with <a href="movements.html">movements</a>.
</li>
</ul>
