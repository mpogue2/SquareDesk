<h2>How to Link to Animations</h2>

<p>
Please feel free to add links from your web site to any of these animations.
You can always get to the introductory page by linking to
<a href="http://www.tamtwirlers.org/tamination/index.html">
http://www.tamtwirlers.org/tamination/index.html</a>
which will redirect to the current location.
</p>

<p>
To link to a specific page of animations, just view the page and copy the address.
Here is the animation for Swing Thru, which is at
<a href="../b2/swing_thru.html">http://www.tamtwirlers.org/tamination/b2/swing_thru.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can also link to a specific animation.  To do this, look at the highlighted text after
selecting the animation.  Concatenate all the text,
removing spaces and any non-alphanumeric
characters (That's anything except a letter or number). You don't need to match the case.
Append a question mark and this text to the link, and it will show it when the
page is loaded.
</p>
<p>
For example, to link to the third animation here, append
<strong>?SwingThrufromRightHandWaves</strong> to the Swing Thru link.  You can even test it out
on this page.  Just go up to the address, type <strong>?SwingThrufromRightHandWaves</strong>
after <strong>howtolink.html</strong>, and press Return.
</p>
