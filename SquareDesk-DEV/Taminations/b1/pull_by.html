<h2>Pull By</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right Pull By:</strong> From Facing Dancers, dancers take right hands as if they were going to shake hands,
exert a momentary, gentle pull to initiate forward motion, and perform a Pass Thru action. As the
dancers pass each other, the handhold is released and the dancers continue the next dance action or
adjust to end back-to-back. The handhold should be just firm enough to establish connection, allowing
either dancer to disengage at will. The Ocean Wave Rule applies to this action.</li>

<li><strong>Left Pull By:</strong> Same as Right Pull By but starting with left hands and passing left shoulders.</li>

<li><strong>Pull By</strong> (e.g., "Box The Gnat; Pull By"): From Facing Dancers only with right (or left) hands already
joined: Right (or Left) Pull By</li>
</ul>
