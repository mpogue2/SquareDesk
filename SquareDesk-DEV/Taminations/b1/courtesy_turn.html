<h2>Courtesy Turn</h2>

<p class="full">Courtesy Turn involves a turning movement with a characteristic handhold and finishes with a couple
facing in. It is mainly used to define and teach calls like Ladies Chain, Chain Down The Line, Right and
Left Thru, Do Paso, and Eight Chain Thru. Occasionally it is used as a call by itself.</p>

<div class="starting-formations"><b>Starting formation</b>Couple (at Basic and Mainstream, a Normal Couple only), or a man and a woman
who are facing</div>

</div>

<div class="dance-action full"><b>Dance action</b> <p>A couple works as a unit and turns around with the left-side dancer backing up and
right-side dancer walking forward. The turning point is halfway between the dancers. Facing dancers
blend into a Normal Couple as they perform this action.</p>
<p>The amount of turning is governed by the following rules below or may be given explicitly. If the rules
are contradictory or none apply, then the amount must be given explicitly.</p>
<ol>
<li>A couple that has other dancers behind it turns 180 degrees to end facing the other dancers.</li>
<li>Dancers working on the outside of the set turn to end facing the center of the set.</li>
<li>If an inactive, outside man is facing in, with an active woman coming towards him, then the couple
turns to face the direction in which the inactive man had been facing.</li>
</ol></div>

<div class="dance-action abbrev"><b>Dance action</b>
Woman places her left hand, palm down, on the man’s left hand which is palm up.
Man places right hand in the small of the Lady’s back. Working as a unit,
the Man backs up while the Lady walks forward. The turning point is midway
between the dancers. Facing dancers blend into a Normal Couple as they perform this action.
</div>

<div class="ending-formation full"><b>Ending formation</b>
Couple facing in (to their group of 4 or the center of the set)</div>
<div class="ending-formation abbrev"><b>Ending formation</b>
Couple. Unless specified by the caller, the couple faces the center of the set
or the center of the formation in which they are working. If the call started
with a man and a woman who are facing, the couple turns to end facing the same
direction in which the man had been facing.
</div>

<div class="timing"><b>Timing</b> 4</div>

<div class="styling full"><b>Styling</b>
<p>The woman's left hand (palm down) and man's left hand (palm up) are joined.</p>
<p>Right hands are placed according to the woman's choice. If she places her right hand behind her right
hip, palm out, then the man places his right hand in hers without grasping it, leaving these hands
available for the next call. If she uses her right hand to work her skirt, then the man places his right
hand in the small of the back (i.e., in the center).</p></div>
<div class="styling abbrev"><b>Styling</b>
When the Lady places her hand on top of the Man’s, she curls fingers over
outside of man’s fingers. This will allow him to better lead her through the
turning motion, especially if she provides a slight counter resistance.
The Lady’s right hand should remain in ready dance position or holding her skirt.
At the end of the Courtesy Turn, the handhold should return to the usual Couple handhold.
</div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b> <p>Courtesy Turn works best when
dancers have their left hands available. For example, Square Thru
3, Courtesy Turn has good hand usage. However, when dancers
already have a Couples handhold, Wheel Around, California Twirl or
Partner Trade may be better choices for smoother dancing.</p>
<p>The turning amount can be given explicitly either by the final facing direction (e.g., &quot;to face back in&quot;),
or the total distance, or both (e.g., &quot;Centers go a full turn around to face the outside 2&quot;).</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;and A Quarter More&quot; can be used after Courtesy Turn or a call ending with Courtesy Turn
(e.g., Right And Left Thru And A Quarter More). The couple turns an extra 90 degrees, generally
ending in a Right-Hand Two-Faced Line.</p>
<p>Calls that end in a Squared Set with a Courtesy Turn (e.g., 4 Ladies Chain or Do Paso) can easily blend
into a left arm turn or into an Allemande Thar. For example, &quot;4 Ladies Chain; Chain Them Back with
a Do Paso&quot;. See &quot;Part 4: Additional Detail: Blending one call into another&quot;.</p></div>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Calling/Teaching Tips</b>
The phrase &quot;And a Quarter More&quot; can be used after Courtesy Turn,
which adds an additional 90 degrees to the turn. The phrase &quot;Full Turn&quot;
can also be used, which would cause couples to turn a full 360 degrees.
