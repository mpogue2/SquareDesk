<p>The designated dancers form a star by stepping forward if necessary and placing the
appropriate hand in the center of the formation. Forming the star may require a dancer to individually
turn in place up to 3/8 of a turn.</p>
<p>Dancers turn the star by walking forward in a circle around the center of the star. The distance
traveled may be specified in fractions of a star full around, or until some condition is met (e.g., Men
Center Left Hand Star, Pick Up Your Partner with an Arm Around, Star Promenade).</p></div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>The stars described above are 4-dancer stars. Stars of 3 or more dancers are also proper, as
long as the caller's instructions to the dancers are understood.</p>
<p>Some callers use 2-dancer stars in place of Arm Turns, accomplishing the hands up styling necessary
in Ocean Waves, and having one less call to teach. While this is acceptable in a teaching situation, and
may be a logical way to understand stars (i.e., 2 or more dancers), 2-dancer stars are not commonly
encountered at dances.</p></div>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Teaching Tip</b>
All stars move forward as soon as they are formed.
