<p>The Ocean Wave Rule applies to this call.</p>

<p>At Basic and Mainstream,
Courtesy Turn is restricted to a man turning a woman.</p>

<p>At Basic and Mainstream, from Facing Lines
in which the centers form a Normal Couple, the caller
should not use &quot;Right and Left Thru&quot;
in the expectation that only the centers will do the call (because
they are the only ones who can due to the above restriction).
The proper call would be &quot;Centers Right and Left Thru&quot;.</p>

<p>On the call &quot;Right and Left Thru, Full Turn&quot;,
the Courtesy Turn will be for a full 360 degrees, and the
ending formation will be Couples Back-To-Back.
See &quot;Part 4: Additional Detail: Commands: Fractions&quot;.</p>

<p>On the call &quot;Right and Left Thru and 1/4 More&quot;,
the Courtesy Turn will be for 270 degrees, and the
ending formation will be a Right-Hand Two-Faced Line.
See &quot;Part 4: Additional Detail: Commands: Fractions&quot;.</p></div>
