an arch. As the dancers move forward the woman does a one quarter (90 degrees) left face turn under

Hands are joined in raised position at approximately eye level, palm to palm, with fingers pointed
up to form an arch. The arch will be offset to the man's right and woman's left. The man's hand should
be used to stabilize as the woman provides her own momentum. As the call is completed, the hand grip
should be readjusted to couple handhold.
