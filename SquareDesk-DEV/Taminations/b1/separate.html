<h2>Separate</h2>

<p class="full">The most general case of Separate is described first. The two most common applications are described in
greater detail next.</p>

<div class="starting-formations"><b>Starting formation</b>
Couple. <span class="full">The couple must be active or designated.</span></div>

<div class="command-examples full"><b>Command examples</b>
<p>Heads Separate and Star Thru</p>
<p>Heads Pass Thru; Separate and behind the Sides Touch 1/4</p>
<p>Heads Pass Thru; Separate and come back home and Swing</p>

</div>

<div class="dance-action full"><b>Dance action</b>
<p>Case 1: The active or designated couple is on Squared Set spots</p>
<p>The dancers turn back-to-back and start walking forward in opposite directions around the outside of
the square away from each other until they meet another dancer. The call ends here unless further
instructions are given (e.g., &quot;and come back home&quot;).</p>
<p>Case 2: The active or designated couple is in the center facing out of the square (e.g., after Heads Slide
Thru, Square Thru 2)</p>
<p>The couple steps forward and then performs the Separate action described above.</p>
</div>

<div class="dance-action abbrev"><b>Dance action</b>
Designated or Active dancers turn back-to-back with each other and proceed
forward around the outside of the square. If an additional call is not given,
they stop when they meet another dancer. Otherwise the distance traveled and
ending formation is determined by the next call.
</div>

<div class="ending-formation full"><b>Ending formation</b>

2, or determined by the distance traveled around the outside</div>

<div class="styling"><b>Styling</b>
Inactive dancers move into the center to get out of the way of the actives. Men's arms in natural
dance position; woman's skirt work optional.</div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>While Separate is usually followed with instructions for walking around some number of
inactive dancers, the active dancers can also be directed to perform some other action (e.g., Separate,
walk around the outside passing 2 dancers and Star Thru with the third).</p>
<p>From a squared set, calling
&quot;Heads Square Thru 2; Heads Separate, ...&quot; would be improper because the
heads are initially facing the sides and when they start in the center they must be facing out of the
square rather than facing other dancers.</p></div>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Teaching Tips</b>
Give dancers practice to identify/know where the lone call Separate actually ends.
It’s the building block for the addition of calls to follow.
Inactive dancers must be aware of where the actives are so they won’t step
on their feet as they dance around them.
</div>


<h3>Around 1 or 2 to a Line</h3>

<div class="starting-formations"><b>Starting formation</b>after a Separate</div>

<div class="command-examples full"><b>Command examples</b>
<p>Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 1 To A Line</p>
<p>Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 2 To A Line</p>
<p>Heads Separate Around 1 To A Line</p>
<p>Heads Square Thru; Split 2, Separate Around 1 To A Line</p>
<p>Heads Square Thru; Split 2, Around 1 To A Line</p>
<p>Heads Right And Left Thru; Veer Left; Tag The Line;
   Split The Sides, First Left, Next Right Around 1 to a Line</p></div>

<div class="dance-action full"><b>Dance action</b>
<p>After a Separate, the active dancers walk around the outside of the set passing the
designated number of inactive dancers. The inactives act as stationary objects (referred to as
goal-posts) and do not change their facing direction. However, they should counterdance as necessary
by stepping forward to allow the actives to walk comfortably around the outside, and then step slightly
backward as the actives pass.</p>
<p>The active dancers pass each other as necessary, using right shoulders (as in Pass Thru). The actives
only count inactive dancers in determining how far to go.</p>
<p>When the active dancers walk around their last inactive dancer, they either squeeze in between the
inactive dancers (who move apart to make room) to become the centers of a general line, or stand
outside the inactive dancers to become the ends of a general line. Which action will happen depends
on where the count ends the active dancers with respect to the location of the inactive dancers.</p>
<p>These actions are sometimes also called
&quot;Squeeze In -- Make Lines&quot; or &quot;Hook On To The End -- Make Lines&quot;,
respectively.</p></div>

<div class="dance-action abbrev"><b>Dance action</b>
<p>Active dancers walk around the outside of the square passing the designated
number of inactive dancers. The inactives act as goalposts (and do not change
their facing direction) but they counterdance as necessary, stepping forward
to allow room for the actives and then moving back into place.</p>
<p>After the actives walk around their last inactive dancer, they either
squeeze in between the inactive dancers (who move apart to make room) to
become centers of a general line or they stop to become ends of a general line.</p>
</div>

<div class="ending-formation full"><b>Ending formation</b>
Usually Facing Lines. Occasionally Inverted Lines or 3&amp;1 Lines.</div>

<div class="timing full"><b>Timing</b>
Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 1 To A Line: 8 Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 2 To A
Line: 10</div>
<div class="timing abbrev"><b>Timing</b>
Around 1 to a Line: 4; Around 2 to a Line: 6

<div class="styling full"><b>Styling</b>
Those not active move into the center to get out of the way of the actives. Men's arms in natural
dance position; ladies' skirt work optional.</div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>While &quot;Around 1&quot; and &quot;Around 2&quot; are the most common,
higher numbers are acceptable. In
all cases, the count is of inactive dancers passed by the active dancers.</p>
<p>Some callers feel that the word &quot;Separate&quot; is required
and the proper call is &quot;Split 2, Separate Around 1 To A Line&quot;.</p>
<p>The sequence &quot;Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 2 And Stand Behind The Sides&quot;
is not proper
because each active dancer didn't go around the second inactive dancer at all.</p>
<p>Around 1 or 2 To A Line is not always preceded by Separate. For example, Heads Pass Thru, Both
Turn Right, Girl Around 1, Boy Around 2, To A Line.</p></div>


<h3>Around 1 or 2 and come into the middle</h3>

<div class="dance-action full"><b>Dance action</b>
<p>Initially the same as <a href="#toaline">Around 1 or 2 to a Line</a>, above.</p>
<p>When the active dancers pass their last inactive dancers, they will either squeeze in between and
through the inactive dancers (who move apart and back together to make room, as in the call Split 2)
to come into the center of the set and take the next call, or will continue forward in a semi-circle around
their last inactive dancers to end in the center of the set, ready to take the next call.</p>
<p>Once the actives enter the center of the set, they are ready to take the next call. The inactive dancers
finish on the outside of the set where they started and do not participate in the next call.</p></div>

<div class="dance-action abbrev"><b>Dance action</b>
<p>This call starts the same as case (a)., above. After the actives walk around their
last inactive dancer, they will either squeeze in between and through the inactive
dancers (who move apart and back together to make room) to come into the center
of the set, or they will continue walking in a semi-circle around their last
inactive dancer to end in the center of the set.</p>
<p>Once the actives enter the center of the set, they are ready to take the next call.</p>
</div>

<div class="ending-formation"><b>Ending formation</b>

<div class="styling full"><b>Styling</b>
Those not active must counter dance. For example, moving forward to provide room when the
actives are on the outside, sliding apart and together when being split, and moving back to place so as
to finish on the outside. Men's arms in natural dance position; woman's skirt work optional.</div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comment</b>
While &quot;Around 1&quot; and &quot;Around 2&quot; are the most common numbers, higher numbers are
acceptable. In all cases, the count is of inactive dancers passed by the active dancers.</div>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Calling Tip</b>
&quot;Come Into the Middle&quot; is often phrased as &quot;Come Into the Middle With A ___&quot;
so that the second call is quickly and easily identified by the designated dancers.
