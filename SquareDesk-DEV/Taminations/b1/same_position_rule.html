<title>Same Position Rule</title>

<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Same Position Rule</h2>

<p>If two dancers are required to occupy the same position at the end of a call, and are facing in opposite directions
from each other, they form a Right-Hand Mini-Wave. If an adjustment is necessary (since they are now two
dancers side-by-side in a formation that expected one dancer), the adjustment is sideways, towards the outside of
the group in which they were working.</p>

<p>Callers should not use a call that would result in two dancers who are facing the same direction, or at right angles,
trying to occupy the same position.</p>

<p>Example: Circulate 1 1/2</p>
