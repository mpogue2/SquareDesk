<h2>Promenade Family</h2>

<p class="full">A promenade is a walk around the set by some or all dancers. The active dancers may go as individuals
or as couples. They may go in promenade direction (counterclockwise when viewed from above) or
wrong way promenade direction. They may travel all the way around the set or a shorter distance.
When not all dancers are active, there is a further choice of traveling around the inside or outside of
the set.</p>

<!--  why oh why are theses slightly different  -->
<p class="abbrev">A promenade is a dance around the set by some or all
    dancers. The active dancers may go as individuals or as couples. They
    may go in the normal promenade direction (counterclockwise) or as a
    Wrong Way Promenade (clockwise). They may travel all the way around
    the set or a distance directed by the caller. They may travel inside
    or outside the set, as directed.</p>

<h3>Couples (Full, 1/2, 3/4)</h3>

If necessary, adjust to a Promenade formation as follows:
<ul><li class="full">A couple will turn as a unit to face promenade direction (counterclockwise)</li>
    <li class="abbrev">From a Squared Set, as a couple, turn to face promenade direction.</li>
    <li class="full">From a Right and Left Grand Circle,
        women turn around in a comfortable direction while men step forward (and to the inside)
        to form normal couples.</li>
    <li class="abbrev">From a Right and Left Grand Circle,
        those facing promenade direction step forward and to the inside while
         the others turn around in a comfortable direction.</li>
</ul>
<p class="full">As a unit, each couple walks in a circular path around the center of the set.
   If certain couples are named, they promenade around the outside of the set unless directed otherwise.</p>
<p class="full">Couples walk the designated amount, if specified.
   On the command &quot;Promenade Home&quot; the couples promenade to the man's home position.
   In both these cases, each couple ends by turning as a unit to face the center of the set.
   On the other hand, if directed to Keep Walking, couples do not turn in
   but rather continue walking until the next command is given.</p>

<p class="abbrev">Each couple, as a unit, walks forward around the
      circle the designated amount or as otherwise directed. On the command
      "Promenade Home" the couples promenade to the man's home position.</p>
<p class="abbrev">If certain couples are named, they promenade
      around the outside of the set, unless instructed otherwise.</p>
<p class="abbrev">All promenades should be more than a quarter of
      the way around the set. If a promenade would go less, then the
      dancers should add a full promenade.</p>
<p class="abbrev">At the end of the promenade each couple turns,
      as a unit, to face the center of the set.</p>

<div class="timing"><b>Timing</b>1/4: 4, 1/2: 8, 3/4: 12, Full: 16</div>

<div class="styling full"><b>Styling</b>
<p>When all Promenade, the inside dancer's distance from the center of the set is slightly
 greater than that of a Star Promenade. If the formation becomes too spread out,
 the outside dancers will have to walk too far and too fast for proper timing.</p>
<p>The styling for Promenade varies widely. CALLERLAB
        recommends a certain styling (described below), but new dancers
        should also be taught the popular styling for their club and
        their region. Experienced dancers may choose among the various
        alternatives based on club and regional standards, the previous
        call, the caller's timing, and their partners’ preferences. For
        simplicity, the following descriptions are given assuming a
        normal couple. There are several alternative handhold positions
        used while promenading. While CALLERLAB recommends the Skater's
        position (described below), new dancers should be taught the
        handhold position in popular use in their region and at their
        club.</p>
<p>Dancers’ left hands are joined in front, with the woman’s left hand, palm down,
resting on the man’s left hand, palm up. Some common alternatives for placement of the right hands are:</p>
      <p>
        <i>Skater's position (CALLERLAB recommended):</i> Right hands
        are similarly joined with the man’s right forearm over the
        woman’s left forearm. Some dancers move their hands in time to
        the music.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Skirt Skater's position:</i> The man’s right arm is behind
        the woman’s back, right hands joined at the right side of the
        woman’s waist. In a variation, the man’s right hand is placed in
        the middle of her lower back while the woman’s right hand holds
        and works her skirt. (See &quot;Skirt Work&quot; in &quot;Part 4: Additional
        Detail: Styling: Other styling terms and issues&quot;.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Varsouvienne position:</i>The woman's right arm is bent, and
        her hand is palm up near her shoulder while the man's right arm
        is behind her, his right hand palm down in her right palm.
      </p>
<p>In addition to the alternatives mentioned above, when designated dancers Promenade a specified distance from a Squared Set (e.g., Heads Promenade 1/2), the couple handhold is also acceptable. This is also common when couples are sashayed or same-sex.</p>
<p>When dancers are not directed to Keep Walking, there are several ways in which they can finish. In all cases, handholds should blend smoothly to end with a couple handhold. Sometimes they simply turn as a couple to face in. At other times they end with a twirl (see "Twirls" in "Part 4: Additional Detail: Styling: Other styling terms and issues"), in which case the twirl should finish as the couple arrives at their destination. There are two alternatives:</p>
<ul><li>Right hands, if joined, are dropped. Then the man leads the twirl by raising their joined left hands, gently guiding the woman through a clockwise twirl underneath.</li>
    <li>Only from the CALLERLAB-recommended position, left hands can instead be dropped. Then the man leads the twirl by raising their joined right hands, gently guiding the woman through a clockwise twirl underneath.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="styling abbrev"><b>Styling</b>
Men’s hands palm up, right forearm over the lady’s left forearm.
Lady’s hands resting palm down on the man’s hands. When there are active
dancers promenading around the outside of the set, the inactive dancers
should take a step toward the center of the set to assist the active dancers
in their trip around the outside.
</div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
    <p>Especially in singing calls, Promenade Home is usually more
      than a quarter of the way around the set. If not, dancers are
      often expected to add a full promenade. As necessary, callers
      should make it clear what is desired.</p>
    <p>On Heads Promenade 1/2, the Sides momentarily step toward the
      center of the set to make room for those promenading. On Heads
      Promenade 3/4 (or 1/4), the Sides step into the center and remain
      there.</p>
    <p>When couples Promenade, it is usually as normal couples.
      Other applications may require workshopping.</p>
    <p>When couples are sashayed or same-sex, Promenade Home can be
      ambiguous (unless everyone is paired with their original partner),
      and the caller must further specify where couples should end
      (e.g., Promenade to the girl’s home).</p>
    <p>The previous call can blend into Promenade. For example, from
      Facing Lines, Reverse Flutterwheel, Promenade Home. See &quot;Part 4:
      Additional Detail: Blending one call into another&quot;.</p>
</div>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Teaching Tip</b>
At the end of a
Right &amp; Left Grand or after an Allemande Left, it’s easy enough to
direct the new dancers to &quot;Meet your partner with a right hand, join
and hold on with your right hands, girls turn back, join your lefts
beneath the rights and Promenade&quot;.
</div>

<h3>Single File Promenade</h3>

<div class="dance-action full"><b>Dance action</b>
<p>Initial turn: If the dancers have a facing direction around the set (e.g., Columns, Promenade
and put the lady in front), no initial turn is necessary. If the dancers are circling they will turn to face
the circling direction. If 4 dancers are designated from a Squared Set (e.g., Ladies Single File
Promenade), they will step into the center and face promenade direction.</p>
<p>Actives move forward around the set (on the inside, or outside if so directed), in single file (one behind
another). The next call determines when the dancers stop and what they do next.</p></div>

<div class="dance-action abbrev"><b>Dance action</b>
Dancers move forward in single file (counterclockwise or clockwise,
inside or outside the square, as directed).
</div>

<div class="ending-formation"><b>Ending formation</b> determined by the next call</div>

<div class="timing"><b>Timing</b>Four dancers promenade inside to home: 8</div>

<div class="styling"><b>Styling</b>
<p>In Single File Promenade man's arms are held in natural dance position; woman's hands on skirt,
working with the natural swinging motion.</p>
<p>When there are active dancers promenading around the outside of the set, the inactive dancers should
take a step toward the center of the set to assist the active dancers in their trip around the outside.
After all active dancers have passed by, the inactives step backward to return to place.</p>
<p class="full">In some areas, while 4 active dancers promenade inside, the inactive dancers clap in time to the music.
Comment: In the past Single File Promenade has not been used with fractions. Recently some callers are
extending the fractional Promenade dance action to Single File Promenade. Dancers do not face in
after they have promenaded the requested amount.</p></div>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Teaching Tip</b>
Inactive dancers who step toward the center should watch the dancers promenading
around behind the opposite couple to know when to step back so as to not step
on the toes of the ones behind them.
</div>

<h3>Wrong Way Promenade</h3>
<p class="abbrev">Like promenade, except the couples promenade clockwise.</p>

<div class="starting-formations full"><b>Starting formations</b>

</div>

<div class="dance-action full"><b>Dance action</b>
Wrong Way Promenade is just like Promenade, except dancers go clockwise (i.e., in the opposite direction of Promenade). However, when starting from a Right And Left Grand Circle with genders as described in the starting formation above, the necessary adjustment, like for Promenade, involves the women turning around as the men step forward, but the men must step to the outside to form normal couples.
</div>

<div class="ending-formation full"><b>Ending formations</b>
Squared Set (e.g., Wrong Way Promenade Home), Wrong Way Promenade (e.g., Wrong Way Promenade, Keep Walking), or couples facing in on the outside of the set (e.g., Sides Wrong Way Promenade 3/4; Heads Square Thru 3).
</div>

<div class="timing full"><b>Timing</b> 1/4: 4, 1/2: 8, 3/4: 12, Full: 16</div>

<div class="styling full"><b>Styling</b> Same as for Promenade.</div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>Wrong Way Promenade is infrequently called and is usually used from normal couples, i.e., the girls will be on the inside.</p>
<p>Some callers omit “Wrong Way” or say “This Way” if dancers are already moving in or facing in wrong way promenade direction.</p>
<p>Also see the comments for Promenade (#5a).</p>
</div>

<h3>Star Promenade</h3>

<div class="starting-formations"><b>Starting formation</b>

<p>Heads Make A Left-Hand Star;
          Pass Your Corner And Pick Up The Same Sex; Star Promenade</p></div>

<div class="dance-action"><b>Dance action</b>
Directed dancers (e.g., men) form (or are already in) a star and turn it. When they encounter
the next directed dancer (e.g., partner) they become a couple, and promenade while retaining the center
star.</div>

<div class="ending-formation"><b>Ending formation</b>
Promenade or Wrong Way Promenade with centers forming a star; the dancers will be
closer together than usual because of the star and arm around the waist.</div>

<div class="timing"><b>Timing</b> 1/2: 6, 3/4: 9, Full: 12, Full plus a back out at home: 16</div>

<div class="styling"><b>Styling</b>
The center star uses the same styling as Right- or Left-Hand Stars. Couples in the star have their
adjacent arms around each other's waists in a modified couple's hold. Any women on the outside use
their outside hand for skirt work. Any men on the outside have their outside hand on their waists or
at their sides.</div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>Here are some calls used while Star Promenading:</p>
<blockquote><p>(women on the outside) Girls Backtrack
Centers Back Out With A Full Turn Around And A Little Bit More; Join 16 and Circle Left
Boys Raise Your Left Hands; Girls Duck Thru To The Partner; Right And Left Grand
Back Out At Home</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is an example of 2-dancer stars being used with Star Promenade:</p>
<blockquote><p>Head Men Make A Left Hand Star; Pick Up Your Partner With An Arm Around And Star
Promenade; She Picks Up Her Corner With An Arm Around And Keep On Moving; Now He Picks
Up His Partner; All Bend The Big Line.</p></blockquote></div>
