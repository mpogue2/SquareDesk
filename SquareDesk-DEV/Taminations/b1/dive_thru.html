<p>One couple makes an arch by raising their joined hands, while the other couple ducks under
the arch. Both move forward. The couple making the arch does a California Twirl.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, it is the couple whose back is to the center of square who makes the arch,
and the outside couple who ducks under. If neither couple has its back to the center of the set, then
the caller must specify who is to make the arch,
or who is to Dive Thru the arch, or preferably both.</p></div>

<div class="styling"><b>Styling</b>
<p>The couple making the arch uses a loose handhold. Stand far enough apart to allow another
couple to dive under. It is permissible for dancers making the arch to part hands momentarily if it is
uncomfortable to reach over diving dancers. The couple making the arch should keep the arch, and
blend smoothly into the California Twirl, rather than dropping their hands and then raising them
again.</p>
<p>Couple diving under uses couple handhold. Bend low enough and stay close enough to partner to move
comfortably underneath the arch.</p></div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>While the smallest starting formation is listed, Dive Thru is almost always called from an Eight
Chain Thru formation, ending in a Double Pass Thru formation.</p>

<p>From a couple facing a single dancer,
one could call, for example, Centers Arch, Head Lady Dive Thru.</p>

<p>The couple making the arch must be a normal
couple in order to be able to do the California Twirl.</p>
</div>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Calling Tip</b>
The couple making the arch must be a normal couple in order to be able to do
the California Twirl. Dive Thru is almost always called from an
Eight Chain Thru formation, ending in a Double Pass Thru formation.
