<h2>Passing Rule</h2>

<p>If the definition of a call has two dancers on the same path and requires them to walk past each other, they should
pass right shoulders (unless otherwise specified) and continue. The mirror image version of a call has dancers
pass left shoulders and continue
(e.g., <a href="../b2/double_pass_thru.html?LeftDoublePassThrufromDoublePassThru">Left Double Pass Thru)</a>.</p>
