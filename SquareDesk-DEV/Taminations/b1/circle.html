<div class="styling"><b>Styling</b> <p class="full">As dancers join hands (couple handhold)
to form a circle, they face slightly left or right as directed.
All dancers walk forward with joined hands, elbows bent comfortably so
that hands are above the elbow.</p>

<p class="full">Couple handhold in circles: In circles with alternating men and women,
men's palms are up and
women's palms are down. In other circles (e.g., BBGG), everyone has the
right-hand palm up and the
left-hand palm down.</p>

<p class="full">Some regions dance 8-dancer circles with a walking step with
no turning motion of the body. Other
regions dance 8-dancer circles with a grapevine step,
with the body and arms turning left and right, in
synchrony with this step, allowing the dancers to make eye contact
with their Corners and Partners
successively.</p>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>The command &quot;Circle&quot;,
without a direction, is a shorthand for Circle Left. It is mainly used
in Singing Calls when required by the timing of the lyrics.</p>
<p>When circling, &quot;Reverse&quot; or &quot;Go The Other Way&quot;
can be used to tell the dancers to stop and circle in the
other direction. It is usually followed with a
&quot;Circle Right (or Left)&quot;.</p>
</div>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Teaching Tip</b>
Dancers should turn their body slightly toward the direction of motion
and shuffle their feet to the beat of the music so that they dance
smoothly forward without bouncing.

<div class="styling full"><b>Styling</b> In a mixed sex circle,
the men dance palms up and the women dance palms down. In a Same Sex
circle, dancers use right hand palm up, left hand palm down.
Some regions always use the latter
styling.</div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b> <p>While the concept of circling with 2
or more dancers is part of the Mainstream program, there
is no well established terminology. Callers wanting circles of 2 dancers
must use terminology familiar
to their dancers.</p>
<p>Some callers use the phrase &quot;Single Circle&quot; for circles of 2 dancers
(e.g., Single Circle &frac34; to A Star
Thru). The phrase &quot;Single Circle&quot; is
not explicitly listed and taught at Mainstream so this usage may
cause communication problems. In addition, the phrase
&quot;Single Circle&quot; is very similar to the call
&quot;<a href="../plus/single_circle_to_a_wave.html">Single Circle To A Wave</a>&quot;
which is part of another dance program.
Some callers feel that the use of the term
&quot;Single Circle&quot; at Mainstream is improper.</p></div>
