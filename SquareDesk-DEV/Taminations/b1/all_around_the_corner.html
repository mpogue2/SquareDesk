  <div class="comments full">
    <b>Comment</b>Square dancing is evolving towards a preference for
    &quot;Walk Around the Corner&quot; instead of &quot;All Around The
    Left-Hand Lady&quot;, which requires the women to mentally translate
    the command to &quot;All Around The Right-Hand Man&quot;.
