<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>From a Tidal formation it is helpful, but not necessary, to say "Each Side".</p>
<p>A couple on the outside of the set (e.g., after a Couples Circulate 1 1/2) can be asked to Bend The Line.
In this case, they assume the other half of their line is towards the center of the set and, working as a
unit, turn 90 degrees to face the center of the set.</p>

Retain handholds in each half of the line. As the very ends move forward, the very centers back
up, equally. Adjust to Facing Lines at the end.</div>

<div class="comments"><b>Comments</b>
<p>From a line of 6, the call &quot;Lines of 6, Bend The Line&quot;
is also acceptable.</p>

<p>Attempts to get dancers to bend lines of 2 dancers
(e.g., Bend The Little Bitty Line) are considered very
unusual and should not be used.</p></div>
