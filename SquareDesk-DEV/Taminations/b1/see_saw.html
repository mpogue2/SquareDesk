   <p>See Saw is almost always preceded by Walk Around the Corner (#26). Other applications may require workshopping. From a Circle or Squared Set, dancers begin by facing the designated dancer.</p>
<p>Formerly See Saw, when not used after All Around the Corner, had the dance action of a Left Dosado. Today callers should say Left Dosado.</p>
<p>&quot;Taw&quot; is an old term for a manâ€™s partner. Its use with See Saw dates back to a time when certain calls were directed primarily toward the men. See the comment for Walk Around The Corner (#26).</p>
