<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>In an Alamo Ring in which the men are facing out, the initial arm turn will be left 3/4 so that
everyone can head to their corner.</p>
<p>Do Paso is used primarily with a directional style of calling, in which many of the calls have vague or
flexible starting or ending formations, usually in circles, thars, and squares. Dancers are expected to
blend smoothly into the next call. The call defines a general pattern, but the specific parts of the call
are typically cued (e.g., &quot;Do Paso; It's partner left, corner right, partner left and hang on tight, make
an Allemande Thar with the men in the middle ...&quot;). Variations can be cued, but the caller should draw
attention to the fact that the typical pattern has been broken (e.g., &quot;Do Paso, turn partner left, turn
corner by the right, Don't Stop Yet! Partner left and corner right, hang on tight, Boys swing in to a
Wrong Way Thar&quot;).</p>
<p>The combination Four Ladies Chain, Chain Them Back with a Do Paso is an example of blending. See
the section &quot;Part 4: Additional Detail: Blending one call into another&quot;.</p>
<p>While primarily a circle-type figure, Do Paso may also be started from 8 Chain Thru (half sashayed)
and Left-Hand Ocean Waves (boys on end).</p>
<p>Do Paso may also be used from circles of 4 and 6 dancers. These applications have received insufficient
use in recent years and will probably require a quick walkthru.</p>
</div>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Calling Tip</b>
Variety can be achieved by using various preceding calls (e.g. Walk Around the Corner)
to lead into the Do Paso, however it is not required. Do Paso is a standalone call.
