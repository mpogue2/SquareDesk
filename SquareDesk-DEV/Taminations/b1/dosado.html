to avoid opposite dancer, right hand forward as right shoulders pass, left hand forward as left shoulders
pass.</p>
<p class="full">Some new dancers dance Dosado with their arms crossed in front of them. While this indicates that
the dancer has been exposed to square dancing in the past, it is not the recommended styling today.
</p>
<p class="abbrev">Arms in natural dance position,
move right shoulder slightly forward while passing each other by the right.
Move left shoulder slightly forward while backup up passing each other by the left.</p>
</div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b> <p>The command "Dosado Your Corner" is a shorthand for "Face Your Corner; Dosado". The same
for "Dosado Your Partner".</p>
<p>The Ocean Wave Rule applies to this call. The ending formation remains Facing Dancers.</p>
<p>From a Squared Set, Head Men Dosado is acceptable. They approach each other, Dosado, and return
to their original position.</p>
<p>A Dosado which starts by passing left shoulders is called Left Dosado.</p>
<p>Formerly the phrase See Saw was occasionally used to accomplish a Left Dosado. In 2003 the
Mainstream Committee voted to drop that application of See Saw and requests that callers use Left
Dosado.</p></div>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Teaching Tip</b>
Remind the dancers that the action is done in one smooth motion without changing
facing directions. As an additional reminder, ask dancers to look each other
in the eyes at the end of the action.
