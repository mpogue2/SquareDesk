Dancers join indicated forearms and walk forward around each other. The amount of turn
can be specified as a fraction (e.g., Half (180 degrees), 3/4 (270 degrees), Full (360 degrees) or implicitly
by the next call (e.g., Turn Partner By the Left; 4 Ladies Chain).</div>
<div class="dance-action abbrev"><b>Dance action</b>
Dancers join indicated (Right or Left) forearms and dance forward around each
other as far as directed or as necessary for the next call
(e.g. Right Arm Turn Partner, To The Corner, Allemande Left).

<div class="styling abbrev"><b>Styling</b>
Arms are held past the wrist but not past the elbow joint.
Each dancer places the hand on the inside of the arm of the person with
whom he/she is to work. Do not squeeze tightly.
The pivot point of the turn is the center of the joined forearms.
</div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>From a Mini-Wave the distance to turn may be specified by a fraction (e.g., Arm Turn 1/2).</p>
<p>From Facing Dancers the distance to turn must be specified by a relative position (e.g., To A Thar, or
To Your Corner) or the next call (e.g., Turn Corner By The Right; Do Paso). It is improper to specify
a fraction.</p>
<p>The Mini-Wave formation does not imply a specific handhold. The styling for Arm Turns and calls
defined with Arm Turns is a Forearm hold. See the section
&quot;Dance Action: Defining Calls with Arm Turns&quot;.</p>

<div class="teaching-tip abbrev"><b>Teaching Tip</b>
