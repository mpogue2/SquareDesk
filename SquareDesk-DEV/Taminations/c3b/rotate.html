<h2>Rotate</h2>

<p>Rotates (Rotate, Reverse Rotate, Single Rotate, and Reverse Single Rotate)
are listed on different challenge lists according to the starting formation.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>At C1,<br/>
    Rotates can only be called from a Generalized Squared Set, or from similar formations (e.g., from Columns, the Ends only).</p>
<p>At C2,<br/>
    Rotates can also be called from Parallel Lines or from a 2 x 2 (e.g., In Your Block Single Rotate 1/4).</p>
<p>At C3B,<br/>
    Rotates can also be called from Columns.</p>
</div>

<h3>Procedure for dancing Rotates:</h3>

        <ol start="0"><li><p>Identify the center point of your setup.</p>

        <p>The center point of your setup is the very center point of the square (commonly called the "flagpole center") except in the following cases:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
            <li><p>If you are in a 2 x 4 formation and are in Lines,
            the center point is the Center of each Box (i.e., work Split).
            If you are in a 2 x 4 T-Bone, the center point for the
            Column dancers is the flagpole center, whereas the
            Line dancers are working Split.</p></li>

            <li><p>If Rotate is preceded by the term <strong>Split</strong>,
            then divide your formation into two equal subformations.
            The center point is the Center of your subformation.
            From a 2 x 4, Split means to divide the setup into two 2 x 2s,
            not two 1 x 4s.</p></li>

            <li><p>If Rotate is preceded by the name of a formation in which to work,
            the center point is the Center of that formation. For example,
            from Columns consider 'Each Column Single Rotate 1/4'.
            In this case, the center point is the Center of the 1 x 4 setup.</p></li>
            </ol>

        </li>
        <li><p>Turn 1/4  <span style="text-decoration:underline">relative to that center point</span> according to the following rules:</p>

        <table class="border">
        <tr><td>Rotate</td>  <td>As Couples 1/4 To Promenade</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Reverse Rotate</td>  <td>As Couples 1/4 To Reverse Promenade</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Single Rotate</td> <td>Individually 1/4 To Promenade</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Reverse Single Rotate</td> <td>Individually 1/4 To Reverse Promenade</td></tr>
        </table>

        <div class="hanging">
        <p><strong>1/4 To Promenade</strong><br/>
            Turn 1/4 so that your left shoulder is toward the Center of your formation.</p>
        <p><strong>1/4 To Reverse Promenade</strong><br/>
            Turn 1/4 so that your right shoulder is toward the Center of your formation.</p>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li><p><a href="../c1/counter_rotate.html">Counter Rotate</a>
         the given fraction around that center point.</p>

        <p>From a Squared Set, active dancers work around the outside of the set. The inactive dancers should move into the center of the set.</p>
