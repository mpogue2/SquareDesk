<title>Triple formations Working direction Concept</title>
</head>
<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Triple <em>formations</em> Working <em>direction</em> Concept</h2>

<p><strong>Triple <em>formations</em> Working <em>direction</em></strong>
is a precise way to state how to do some 12-Matrix calls.</p>

<p>This concept allows for 8-dancer calls to be done from
Triple <em>formations</em> such as
Triple Boxes | Columns | Diamonds | Lines | Waves.
Normally from these formations we are limited to
4-dancer (or fewer) calls, since each sub-formation
(Box, Column, Diamond, Line, or Wave) contains only four spots.</p>

<p>On <strong>Triple <em>formations</em> Working <em>direction</em></strong>,
each dancer selects a subset of eight (out of 12) spots in which to work.
The dancers within the outside Triple formations must always select
to work within the four spots in their Triple <em>formation</em>
and the four spots in the center Triple <em>formation</em>.
The dancers in the center Triple <em>formation</em> work with the four spots
in their Triple <em>formation</em> and the four spots in the outside
Triple <em>formation</em> which is toward the given <em>direction</em>.
If the <em>direction</em> is <strong>forward</strong>,
the Center dancers work with the outside
Triple formation which they are <strong>facing</strong>.
If the <em>direction</em> is <strong>backward</strong>,
they work with the outside Triple formation which is <strong>behind</strong> them.
If the <em>direction</em> is <strong>Right</strong>
(or <strong>Left</strong>), they work with the outside Triple formation
which is toward their <strong>Right</strong> (or <strong>Left</strong>).
If the <em>direction</em> is <strong>Together</strong>, they work with the outside
Triple formation that is closest to them.
If the <em>direction</em> is <strong>Apart</strong>,
they work with the Triple formation that is furthest from them.</p>
