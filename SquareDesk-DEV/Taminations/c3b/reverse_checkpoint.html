<h2>Reverse Checkpoint <em>anything</em> By <em>anything</em></h2>

<p>From applicable formations.</p>

<p>Center 4 do the first <em>anything</em> call and the resulting Ends
(of that Center 4) move away from the Center of the Set
without changing their facing direction (i.e., Stable).
The Others (original Outsides) work around the Very Centers
to do the second <em>anything</em> call,
ending as close as possible to the positions
vacated by the resulting Ends of the Center 4.</p>
