 * This is the Cookie() constructor function.
 *
 * This constructor looks for a cookie with the specified name for the
 * current document.  If one exists, it parses its value into a set of
 * name/value pairs and stores those values as properties of the newly created
 * object.
 *
 * To store new data in the cookie, simply set properties of the Cookie
 * object.  Avoid properties named "store" and "remove" since these are
 * reserved as method names.
 *
 * To save cookie data in the web browser's local store, call store().
 * To remove cookie data from the browser's store, call remove().
 *
 * The static method Cookie.enabled() returns true if cookies are
 * enabled and returns false otherwise.
