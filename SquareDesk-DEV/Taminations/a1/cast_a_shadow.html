and <a href="../plus/anything_and_spread.html">Spread</a>,
to become the ends of the resulting formation. The centers
facing out <a href="../ms/cloverleaf.html"> Cloverleaf</a> to step in between the casting dancers.
The centers facing in
<a href="../plus/extend.html">Extend</a>, <a href="../ms/hinge.html">Hinge</a>,
and Extend to fill the vacant spot. However, if all the centers are facing
in, they <a href="pass_in.html"> Pass In</a> and <a href="../b1/pass_thru.html"> Pass Thru</a>,

<p>From promenade: The caller must designate two couples, e.g., Heads Cast a Shadow.
Everyone acts as though the formation were two-faced lines, with the designated couples as
the leads. Thus, the outsides do a &frac12; Zoom
with the designated outside acting as the lead), Arm Turn &frac34;, and Spread, while the
designated centers <a href="../ms/cloverleaf.html">Cloverleaf</a>,
and the other centers Hinge and Extend. Ends in parallel
waves.</p>
<p>By vote of the Advanced Committee, this call is not to be done from columns.</p>
