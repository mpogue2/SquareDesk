<body><div class="definition">
<h2>Brace Thru</h2>
<p>(formerly Half Breed Thru)</p>
<p>From facing couples, each composed of a man and a woman:
<span class="Part1">All Right <a href="../b1/pull_by.html"> Pull By</a></span>.
<span class="Part2">Those dancers (if any) in a normal couple
<a href="../b1/courtesy_turn.html"> Courtesy Turn</a>
to end facing the other couple. Those in
a half sashayed couple <a href="../b1/turn_back.html"> U-Turn Back</a>,
turning toward each other</span>.
Ends in normal facing couples.</p>

<p>
Note: In 2012 the name of this call was changed from Half Breed Thru to Brace Thru. The new
name was chosen because the final action is the call Brace Yourself (which is not on the Advanced
program).
